0,The ranchers seem motivated by mostly by greed; no one should have the right to allow their animals destroy public land.
0,It was a great show. Not a combo I'd of expected to be good together but it was.
0,"Wow, that sounds great."
0.44,"This is a great story. Man. I wonder if the person who yelled ""shut the fuck up!"" at him ever heard it."
0,This seems like a step in the right direction.
0.6,"It's ridiculous that these guys are being called ""protesters"". Being armed is a threat of violence, which makes them terrorists."
0.5,"This story gets more ridiculous by the hour! And, I love that people are sending these guys dildos in the mail now. But… if they really think there's a happy ending in this for any of them, I think they're even more deluded than all of the jokes about them assume."
0,"I agree; I don't want to grant them the legitimacy of protestors. They're greedy, small-minded people who somehow seem to share the mass delusion that this is not only a good idea for themselves as individuals, but is the right thing to do for ranchers at large. Basically: take something that currently belongs to everyone, and give it to a select group of people, so they can profit."
0,Interesting. I'll be curious to see how this works out. I often refrain from commenting because I don't have the time or desire to engage with the couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.
0,Awesome! I love Civil Comments!
0,"I'm glad you're working on this, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.    The comments sections of online news stories have the potential to be great tools for community interaction about current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of the reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform for news and local discussions is that there's a sense of community interaction that's often lacking in my ""real life,"" hectic discussions.    But hopefully we won't be tempted to silence those who take unpopular stances."
0.5,"Angry trolls, misogynists and Racists"", oh my. It doesn't take all of my 150 IQ to see the slant here.  it's the ""Diversity diode"" at work yet again. ""We can say anything that we want because we are Diversity. You on the other hand must only  say what we allow you to say. From now on, winning arguments against any member of diversity will be considered offensive language.  facts, cogent, linear posts and Math are now verboten."
0,Nice to some attempts to try to make comments better—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended with the launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.
0,"One would hope that the purpose of introducing this system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems there are several things that limit the flow of discussion:  Making comments that are personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; true spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in my experience); and chasing rabbits to draw discussions away from the primary subject at hand.  I, for one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits the ability of people to talk with each other.  I'm believing that this is the intention of your newspaper here, and I hope it's a movement that results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it."
0,"Comments will be randomly chosen and be reviewed by more than one person. But I bet the Civil people have an even better, more thorough answer to this question!"
0,She would be a major improvement for city council and she has a long history of giving all citizens a voice. She is a problem solver that is what Portland needs .
0,"I agree! Comments have so much potential to be places for active discussion, especially in publications that already serve an amazing community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure that the comments section won't become an echo chamber, though, by combining clever algorithms on the backend with the peer reviews. That's also why there are two separate questions: ""is this a *good* comment?"" and ""is this comment civil?"""
0,"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed the system assuming that people *will* try to abuse it. So, in addition to the peer reviews, there are algorithms on the backend doing a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure the system isn't 100% perfect yet, but we know from months of beta testing that it's a really solid start, and we'll keep working to improve it!"
0,"Thanks, Christa!  Will you be adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of the article itself?  Also, notification settings for users?"
0,"Our aim is actually the opposite: we want spirited debate in which everyone feels free to participate, without fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Right now, a lot of voices are being silenced due to that fear. We designed Civil Comments for civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. There's a lot going on on the backend to prevent abuse of the system. So, everyone is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—so long as they treat each other with respect."
0,"Thanks! We're really going to try — not only to improve civility, but also to make comments more dynamic and interesting."
0,I applaud Civil's efforts to create some new technology in this field. Hoping for more thoughtful discussions moving forward.
0,Why bother writing a review if it's going to be this devoid of content?  I understand that you work for WW. (but that hardly seems like an excuse when Fred Armisen recorded radio voices for Grand Theft Auto IV with the same number of people.)
0.9125,Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?
0,"I love the idea of upvoting entire articles, though this would have to be something that the Publisher could turn on and off. We do have a ton of other features currently in the works—following (and blocking!) other users, bookmarking articles during the review process, to read later (I find myself wanting to read the articles that other people are commenting on, as I'm reviewing their comments!), following conversations, and so much more. Thanks for your enthusiasm, Melinda, and your patience! It's a brand-new way to approach comments, and we're going to continue to improve it. We welcome all suggestions and feedback!"

0,"I already see dozens of ""just commenting to vote on comments to be able to comment"" type of comments.  This voting system is completely insane- you're assuming people have the extra time to *actually read* multiple non related comments?  I would love to see this system installed on oregonlive.com - they have enough online visitors and an established ""troll"" base to really need this service.  With as little online activity as wweek has - it will discourage further growth here."
0,Very cool project!
0,Awesome! Signed up just to give this a shot... good luck to your enterprise!
0,"disqus has way more functionality and obviously a huge following - it can increase visitor count significantly.  disqus also has a moderator feature - a feature that wweek either never wanted to pay their staff to undertake, or never developed a group of people they could trust to do it on their behalf on a volunteer basis."

0.2,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love WW content but the comment section has polluted for far too long. The lack of community moderation gave a loud megaphone to a small number of right wing trolls."
0,Probably because they consistently waste funds on trendy projects like green bike boxes -- which cost a fortune and have to be repainted every couple of years.  Oy.

0,"""winning arguments against any member of diversity""  You may have inadvertently given Civil Comments an idea for the 2.0 version of their system.  1. Is this a good comment?  2. Is this comment civil?  3. Did this comment totally just win the argument???"

0,"I've been loosely following Civil Comments since it was announced late last year; I even tried a beta demonstration. One thing I've been wondering is: will users will have to sign up for new profiles on any site that uses Civil, or do you have one Civil profile that you'd use on any partner site?"
0,My sign-up just now couldn't have been smoother!
0.3,"I couldn't be more pleased. Comments on many sites too often get overtaken by trolls. It's the first I've heard of Civil, but I like its intent and encourage other publications in town to consider comments as a platform for engagement rather than a troll-driven click driver intended to boost online ad rates."
0,"Thanks so much for following our progress and helping to test the software, David! To answer your question: you'll have one over-arching Civil account where you can manage different profiles for different sites. Of course, you're welcome to use the same information across all sites! We decided that it'd be best to be able to present yourself differently to different communities, though. I might, for example, want to be portland_hipster15 here on Willamette Week, but prefer to be MrWhiskers on Cat Enthusiast Digest!"

What are the economics of their situation -- are they in the same situation as chicken farmers, where they have had their livelihoods squeezed away ... I'd like to understand what drives someone who seems to have so much to be so alienated, and their economic situation must play into that."

0,I think you left out one very important organization who help the mentally ill over 18. NAMI Multnomah. They help people with mental distress find within or without NAMI to find them the services that can be most beneficial to them.  I am a volunteer for NAMI Multnomah in their Connection program. It is a walk-in group to people 18 and up. No matter the diagnosis we welcome them and help them learn new coping skills and develop tools to further  help them learn to cope from week to week. We have groups all over Multnomah County. By going  to http://nami.multnomah.org/. You will with out much difficulty find the list of Connection Groups and their times and locations.
0,"Thanks for the info! One other thing I just noticed: in the email I got about your reply, the link to view it didn't work (at least not from Mail.app on OS X). Looks like it came through as x-webdoc:// and probably doesn't know how to deal with that scheme.  Really love what you're doing with Civil Comments, though! Can't wait to see it on more sites. Might even bring back comments on my personal site once it's available!"
0,Interesting idea. I tend to use content blockers on sites that I know don't moderate comments very well. If they adopted a system like this I might stop doing that.

Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here. Traffic is bad enough.  No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.

0,"All the framed boxes must take up extra code and bandwidth usage to send all the extra code to our browsers..  Then there is all the ""2 more replies"" buttons to click on - that is amazingly annoying - I don't want to have to click on half a dozen ""more replies"" buttons to see what is being said.  And really, you have to vote on 3 other replies? What percentage of your users wait more than 1/2 second before randomly clicking on a response? Oh well, I digress."
0,"Ah, so part of the ""back end"" and ""algorithms"" - automatic comment rejection if you don't vote on the 3 random comments in a way that is conforming enough to the way other users vote - or if you vote too fast, as I assumed many would do - just clicking a random button too quickly means that you're unwilling to ""participate"" - you just want to ""comment"" which doesn't ensure a ""civil"" community of commenters :  Screen grab from a rejected comment : i5guy 3 hours ago Rejected Personally, I already don’t have the time or energy to actually read the stuff they ask me to vote on. I’ll just randomly click on yes sorta or no to make the buttons go away.  Problems were detected in the ratings you left for your peers."

And last time I checked a onzie of a cheetah bought at target is fine but suddenly I'm wearing one bought online and I'm appropiating a whole country?

We all do not obsessed about and or dress up. Only 10% 15% furs   dress up in costume; you find a great ratio of costumers (cosplay) at Kumoricon and New Con than a fur con.  We fur have many different and dare say family  friendly  safe for work interest including art, role  play and  literature.

Forcing the writers or other staff to monitor comments might be overkill.  I definitely get a newspaper not wanting outsiders handling that, for fear of confusion and accusations of bias.  It seems like every OregonLive comment thread has accusations of bias due to deleted posts despite repeated insistence that comment moderation is not handled in-house.  I've also seen several communities where conforming to the political view is more of a metric for desirability than anything to do with tone or actual content, and mods reinforced that.  The results of volunteers may....vary, to be polite."
0.166666667,"I saw @christa_m mention this a little below, but I'm curious how the system combats the echo chamber effect, especially on contentious issues?  I can imagine many stories where opinions which run against the (Portland) mainstream are viewed as inherently uncivil, such as supporting Trump's position on...well pretty much anyone that isn't white, or say supporting the Kleins in the Sweet Cakes by Melissa saga.  How do you convince people that an opinion which is to some degree derived from some form of prejudice is still ""civil"" and deserving of at least being heard?"

0,"Hopefully there will be enough commenters who are honestly here to have a civil discussion to allow civil comments that challenge conventional wisdom. The posts that challenge conventional wisdom yet aren't civil won't hit the thread, and, sure, some folks will always try and scam the system by not allowing comments that they disagree with thru, but I wouldn't be surprised if many of the folks that take that approach when reviewing comments are the same ones who are having comments denied for being uncivil.  If that's the case it may be somewhat of a self-correcting problem, where they become bored with not having any comments post and go elsewhere.  I'm just speculating however only time will tell. I also would not be surprised if I was totally off base on all of this."

0,"If it is effective in slowing us down in order to reflect upon how we engage with others and draws attention to the humanity of each recipient, then I approve."
0,"Hi David, we did consider all of these possibilities when building our system! In fact, we assume people will try to game it; that's why we have a lot going on behind the scenes algorithmically. The commenter-facing part of the app is very straightforward, but there are a lot of checks and balances on the backend to prevent coordinated attacks and also to keep comments sections from becoming echo chambers. Banning insulting words isn't enough, unfortunately; people will always be smarter than word filters, even if the algorithm tries to take context into account. We do have a backup algorithm for low-volume situations that basically does this (plus a few other things), but it's not as effective as human reviewers.  I hear you on the ""more replies"" button; I don't think we'll remove it entirely, but I agree it's appearing too often, after too few comments. We'll be pushing updates very soon!"

0,"Getting rid of a way to truncate long reply threads seems like it might cause other problems. For example, if folks are sorting the comments by what's most popular (which is a handy feature) and there isn't a way to truncate the replies, everyone who replies to the top-most comment has their post appear above everyone else who simply posts to the main thread. Something like this:   1. I'm the most popular comment!       a. response      b. response      c. response      d. response      e. response      f. response      g. response      h. response      i. response      J. response 2. I'm the second most popular comment.        a. response      b. response      c. response  Imagining a scenario where the most popular comment has 200 responses on it, this could be a real pain.

Giving them priority in programs like this helps to raise some of them up to the starting point of other kids. For example, David Bowie and Alan Rickman, two amazing creative artists we lost this week, both benefited from government-funded arts educations that their parents otherwise would never have been able to afford! Because they were able to go to art school for free, though, they bettered their own lives. And the rest of the world benefitted from their work!"

Giving low-income kids priority doesn't limit other kids, who have plenty of enrichment opportunities (including the same government-funded ones!)

0,"While I was initially conflicted upon hearing this, the more I think about it the more I feel that having two separate min. wages isn't a good idea. While the idea of helping deal with cost of living in Portland is noble, this doesn't help anyone who may live there but work outside the ""Urban Growth Boundary"" for instance. Similarly, as Nick mentions, this may also incite people to live outside the boundary and pursue jobs within and on the other hand, some businesses, if given the option, may elect to open up or relocate outside the boundary in order to avoid the higher minimum wage."

None of those things are conducive to furthering actual conversation or revealing ""ugly truths.""   Personal attacks, harassment, and death threats only silence people—either through fear or by forcing sites to turn off their comments entirely.  Spirited debate—even angry words!—are acceptable so long as they're respectful of other people. I hope you'll agree that mutual respect is a reasonable expectation for public discussion, even when negative emotions are involved."

0,"Good question, Jackie! How do these yokels make their money? Well, LaVoy Finicum just had his foster children taken from his ranch, likely as a result of him becoming a militant criminal likely to face a suite of federal felony charges. Some reports and tax filings from his home state suggest Finicum was receiving, some years, $100,000 from Catholic Charities to provide foster care. While - according to his statements to the media - his cows barely pay for ranch expenses, the money from the kids could presumably pay for his lifestyle (surely other state money also helped). Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids."
0,"Am I missing something, because there's nothing about the ""free-range, organic, cruelty-free"" section that appeared to be joking, or have any self-deprecating self-awareness, which is what this whole deal hinges on. Are there any commenters who are going to call the supervisor on this obvious distortion?   I think this email-leaking parent did exactly the right thing. If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in ""confronting her directly"". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was ""a joke"", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar ""earth friendly"" and ""cruelty free""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.  There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating ""earth friendly"" and ""human healthy"" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products. In any case, she's recommending they make cakes out of cookie or brownie or cake batters. The number 1 or 2 ingredient is going to be some form of sugar, which is probably the worst thing you could eat, health-wise, and ""plantation-consciousness""-wise, anyway."

Note how the FBI seems to think that the media and locals of Burns are the problem not the ""occupation"".

So, anytime they receive a complaint of abuse, they either ignore it or investigate and find no substantiation. You bet the agency serves its best interests and not the interests of the children. PDX Grandma is right. The state takes far too many children into custody and for frivolous reasons to get the federal funding that keeps the agency existence justified. Nothing is going to change until the public gets invovled, starts asking questions of their legislators and to find out what their tax dollars is really supporting."

0,"This comment system is so crappy you can't cut and paste a reasonable sized document, so here goes in multiple posts the actual ballot measure as voted on.  Nowhere will you find an elephant reserve listed. There is no breach of contracts  QUESTION: Shall Zoo protect animal health and safety; conserve, recycle water; issue $125 million in general obligation bonds; require independent audits?  If the bonds are approved, they will be payable from taxes on property or property ownership that are not subject to the limits of Sections 11 and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.  SUMMARY: Measure will: Provide more humane care for animals: update four outdated and undersized enclosures with larger, more natural and safer spaces  Protect animal health and safety: modernize Zoo's substandard 45 year old animal clinic determined deficient by the American Zoo Association."
0,"Part 2 of the actual ballot measure.  Increase access to conservation education: provide more space for summer camps, classes and hands-on learning for kids, adults, and families.  Improve water quality: replace the Zoo's 1950's sewer system, reducing pollution by separating sewage from storm water, harvesting runoff for reuse.  Conserve, reuse water: install water recycling filtration systems; replace leaking, worn-out plumbing, irrigation systems, saving 11,000,000 gallons of water annually.  Improvements will meet sustainability standards.  EXPLANATORY STATEMENT  The Oregon Zoo is committed to the conservation of endangered species and their habitats–both locally and around the globe–while at the same time providing adults and children with one-of-a kind recreational experiences and hands-on-learning about wildlife and conservation."
0,"Part 3 ballot measure It is the oldest zoo west of the Mississippi ; during its 50-year history at the current location, key parts of the Zoo have become old, out-of-date and worn out.  The Zoo bond measure will update and replace old exhibits and facilities, increase access to conservation education, and replace utility systems to reduce water and energy use and lower operating costs.  More Humane Conditions for Elephants Outdoor space will increase from 1.5 to 6 acres, adding watering holes, shade structures, large trees, and boulders, providing more outside exercise and offering a more natural environment.  Protecting the Health of Polar Bears Provide cooler temperatures and more humane conditions by removing concrete and adding land and pool space.  More Humane Enclosures for Apes and Monkeys A renovated exhibit will replace the current cage-like conditions with larger indoor and outdoor areas, adding running water and more natural conditions."
0,"Part 4 of ballot measure.  Dedicated Space for Conservation Education Replace two 12 year old modular trailers, a former storage space, a basement and leased off-site space with new presentation, classes and camp space for the over 100,000 children and adults attending annually.  Condors Provide an on-site Condor exhibit.  Protect Animal Health & Safety Replace the substandard 45-year old animal hospital and quarantine buildings with facilities meeting modern standards."
0,"I wasn't living in Portland in 2008, but have seen the taped statement of Metro councilmember Collette assuring an audience, prior to the vote, that an off-site preserve for the elephants would definitely be included in the zoo bond. Metro and the zoo are continuing to treat these animals as a commodity and profit generator."
0,"Part 5 of ballot measure  Save Water, Reduce Water Pollution, Improve Water Quality Since most of the zoo's pipes, plumbing and irrigation systems also date back to the 1950s and '60s, many are outdated, leaking and well past their useful lives. The most expensive utility cost at the 55-acre zoo is water, and leaking pipes, run-off, inadequate filtration systems, and lack of water storage all contribute to wasting water and increasing costs. Replacing the sewer system and separating sewage from storm water will reduce pollution, improve water quality and save costs. Adding modern water filtration and recycling systems to the hippo and penguin pools will save over 11,000,000 gallons of water every year.  That's all the relevant parts of the ballot measure. No mention of an elephant reserve. That's what was voted on.  Too bad WWEEK couldn't provide some level of in depth reporting, instead resorting to click bait."

0,"Nick - I would be delighted if climate activists were showing up to argue for both density and housing affordability. Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens. As to gentrification, cause gentrification; what causes gentrification is rich people moving here. If we built zero new housing, the rich people moving in would still drive up the price of the existing housing."

0,"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.  The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).  Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.  It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.  Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.  Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion."
0,"An elephant in a zoo is an animal exhibition in a sterile, unnatural environment. Artificial breeding is not natural. It is a tortuous procedure as tubes for insemination are forced up the female's reproductive tract. Elephants in zoos are prone to TB, hepatitis, joint and foot problems, and early deaths, not to mention boredom and depression of constricted movement.   In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.  They are more apt to flourish and show off their gentle and playful personalities.  Visitors see an elephant more similar to those in the wild.  In sanctuary, it's a win-win for elephants and patrons alike! I have seen zoo elephants, and wild elephants in Africa.  It's disappointing that Metro is backing out of the reserve."

0,"There is an option that would be a better long term solution. Move the Spanish immersion program (SIP) from its location at Ainsworth to a currently unused facility like east Sylvan. This will open up room for 300 students at Ainsworth.  The overall PPS SIP is a great concept and espouses the goals of diversity, accessibility, and inclusion.  However, the SIP at Ainsworth is the dirty little secret of the Westside. It does not meet any of the above goals. There is no diversity, access is difficult, and it is run like an exclusive private school, funded by taxpayer money. Schools overcrowded? No problem, SIP is capped at 26 students per class. Lack of budget for teachers? Not an issue, SIP has assistant teachers for every class!    How is this even compatible with the PPS equity initiative?  Moving the Ainsworth SIP will help meet its true goals, but there is strong resistance to this because it would inconvenience some privileged families that live in the mansions close to the school."

Star Trek ships also can reach higher speeds and go up to 9 times the speed of light.   Fights between the Republic and the Empire are complete junk as the Republic is always outgunned like 30 to 1 but still win.

0,"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)"

Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show.   Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.   I wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion."

It's out of state money buying apartments and upping the rent to cover the costs associated with flipping apartment buildings.

This just proves that we cannot trust our government to tell the truth. But we still need to hold them accountable for their statements to the public.  And since there was so much public outcry about the preserve, Metro did option land, did hold hearings to discuss the plans for the preserve and did target in 2008 $12 million for captital expenses and a feasibility study. So why claim it was never part of the bond? Because all the money was spent on the new exhibit? Or it was a ruse to fool the public about their real intentions to never provide a preserve."

0,"In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.  Hi Rachel,  In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment."
0,"To my knowledge, the commissioner has yet to endorse Anti-Displacement PDX's 28 measures in the Comprehensive Plan. This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city.   I am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.  All the best,  Adam"
0,"I worry that pursuing density in the current market may be condemning us to repeat the same eco-apartheid we're already seeing--that's worsening--in inner Portland neighborhoods where sustainable, walkable, green neighborhoods are available exclusively to wealthier residents who can afford it.   From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""  Me: ""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>"
0,"""...I think that others understand that while density may require sacrifice, that it's a necessary direction to go.   It's one thing if the density is resulting in more sustainable livable communities, but we are not exactly evaluating these developments and this growth on both sides of the ledger--including in particular metrics for displacement. We aren't requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we're facing. Many people in the grassroots understands that density is a radically transformational force in neighborhoods--and one that is controversial in both legitimate ways and in NIMBYist ways.

They are also able to privately capture the value that is added with things like infrastructure improvements, even though those things are publicly funded. But it's possible to control this with things like Community Land Trusts. Rich people are only able to drive up prices because our uncontrolled, private market, that treats housing as just another commodity rather than a human right, allows it.   Sustainable living for the rich, while everybody else gets pushed to the suburbs, is not Climate Justice. It's actually a grave injustice to all the people who want to live in a sustainable Portland but are basically being told they don't deserve to because they don't make enough money. Fix that and people might get on board with development."

0,"Yes, public transportation services Like Uber and Lift, now subject to the City's regulatory code, should be held to the same standards that every other public transportation provider is held to.    Taxis have an unfunded mandate from the City requiring them to have wheelchair accessible vehicles in at least 10% of their fleet.  They can only charge the same rates as regular cabs.  This results in the taxi companies subsidizing them, while at the same time trying to remain competitive with a huge multi-national corporation that does not share that mandate.  While this denial of service to wheelchair-bound users is probably the most egregious of Novick's concessions to Uber (although I would argue that a close second is surely the Non-Disclosure Agreement they signed) there are many others, such as requiring smart phones and credit cards.   This disproportionately affects the elderly and low-income.  Too bad they don't have lobbyists, Uber has 10."

Unless they are union they don't really get the jobs with stock options and generous 401k matches.  The fact that redlining once existed doesn't make the handful of black residents around Alberta less attached to their homes.  You are struggling with he fact that the working class folks in Portland do not want to live the New Urbanist dream.  Look at the big study Metro did to gauge housing preferences.   Finally, I note you put a lot of trust in the people who own large apartment complexes to not exploit the inherent vulnerability that comes with being a renter.  The SFH gives people autonomy.  Yes, housing prices can drop, but so can any other investment.  Take my 401k- please..."

The Secretary of State decides what is left in and left out. The bond was pitched to the public with the preserve and there are many statements by the zoo and Metro that promised the preserve to the public. The resolution  called for capital expenses of $12 million to be set aside for a possible offsite preserve. The onsite exhibit was budgeted at $19 million, now skyrocketed to $59 milllion. The voters did not approve $59 million for an onsite exhibit and after a disastrous 2009 audit in which Metro was criticized for mismanaging bond monies, Metro came up with this grossly inflated figure and a ""master plan"" that was created after the vote."

Portland is not unique in terms of rising rents, gentrification, the city center getting more crowded and competitive, etc.  And it's definitely not unique in the fact that its character is changing - that also happens with every other city.

0,"I'm disturbed the the phrase ""...Bernie supporters and the threat they pose to the Democratic unity bridge.....""  I understand that being overworked and over saturated with the politics involved in a revolution can take its toll, but I think that blaming it on Bernie supporters (as if they are any different than Hillary supporters) is unfair. It smacks of favoritism, which pretty much shoots down any ""unity"" argument.  Politics is no longer about unwavering loyalty to The Party, and absolute, unquestioning support of The One favorite within that party. It's an ""all bets are off"" revolt against the trap that is a two party system. It can be quite an adjustment to accept that no one is required to support a candidate just because of party affiliation.   Yes, it's hard to deal with. No, it's not supposed to be ""civil.""  It's revolution.  Revolutions are always disruptive and painful. At least we aren't facing down tanks in the street."

Revolution isn't supposed to be a cake walk. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. Progress is always unsettling. That doesn't make it a bad thing, except to those who have gotten too comfortable with their place in the status quo."

I guess they can bulldoze spawning beds and nesting grounds too because they  are real men and not accountable to anyone.  I suspect that what these intruders  really care about is a land grab and cheap grazing rights for their cattle back in their home states.  Many ranchers in Oregon are responsible caretakers of the land.  They've worked out creative solutions with government agencies and environmental groups to continue using the property while protecting streambanks and wildlife.

What San Francisco has in spades is an anti-development zoning code and general mentality, which prevents new housing (including affordable housing) from being built.  Inclusionary zoning combined with easing zoning restrictions (e.g., parking requirements) for certain types of residential construction could go a long way towards increasing affordable housing *and* creating the density/walkability that promotes sustainable living practices, and is the best place to start at this point in Portland's transformation.

Our nation's founders didn't foresee wiretapping and little Sally having a Bouncing Betty for show-and-tell and so forth, so the government adapts to handle things. Sometimes it adapts well, sometimes not-so-well. It wasn't created to remain immutable, though."

0,"Dear Willamette Weak, I am writing in regards to your recent article concerning the Northwest Academy. As a student, I would like to point out numerous factual errors in your article. First of all, I respect every students’ and parents’ right to disagree with the decision that was made. However, I would like to point that 1) the student in question, with the hit list, was seen by a professional who deals with troubled adolescents. They stated to the school that he did not pose any threat to himself or other students. The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school. As admittedly inappropriate as it was, it is irresponsible to imply the school ignored a threat to any student’s safety. 2) The implication that because this is a 20K tuition school it should not provide students with a second chance or hold them under more social scrutiny than any other institution is absurd."
0,"(Part Two) It is expensive because it provides a higher academic education in an arts based environment that is not offered elsewhere, not because we have an inherently better-than-public-school student body.

Third of all, and most importantly, the insinuation that Mrs. Folberg’s retirement has anything to with issue is reckless, and I question your journalistic integrity by publishing that article that led the public to such blatantly incorrect ideas. Mary is an amazing head of school; we all love her. But, she has been thinking of retiring for a while, and only recently announced it."

While in no way do I wish official intervention had led to any loss of life, I most assuredly have far more concern for their being held accountable than I do for the details of their arrest.

The fact that you added the Northwest Academy's price tag in the first sentence creates a biased view towards the school. The fact that NWA costs 20k has absolutely nothing to do with the matter, and reduces the credibility of your ""article"" even lower. 3. This article is painfully short, this could have been written in five minutes. Good journalism requires the reporter to actually research and report, not rely on other's opinions. The only thing you have achieved with this article is portraying NWA in a bad light. Congratulations."

At the same time the head of school resigned (although it appears from the comment section that the head of school did not resign, but rather announced her retirement).  Are there any facts connecting the two occurrences?  What a reporter does is uncover facts that tell a story.  What this “reporter” did was repeat a rumor.  I see the author of the article has been employed by WW for about 1 month.  WW’s editors should more closely monitor the work of their junior staff."

I am not voicing my opinion on if i agree with the decision that was made by the faculty council or not. What I am doing, however, is voicing my disagreement with the idiotic nature of this article, its reckless journalism, and the fact that every student has a right to privacy, including the student with the list. I agree every parent has a right to know the rational behind the decision, but not much more. You sent your child there, if you don't trust the admin to do the right thing, then pull them out. Otherwise, respect everyone's privacy and trust that professional educators know what they're doing, especially based on a therapeutic professional's advisement. The student was tested, and the conclusion was he was safe to return."

The writer could have looked at OLCC, whether or not their enforcement actions are fair or just. He didn't.  Having said that, Toth's not doing herself any favors.  From the article: ""In one of these incidents, in September, Toth told OLCC officers that bartenders had been paid in ""donations.""""

This is Olcc kicking up dirt, there was nothing in violation. The suggested donation box was a question for the inspectors when they arrived. They prohibited this so it was not used. It's not a crime to ASK an official prior to make sure your in compliance.  No alcohol was sold at Canna Ball it was misquoted to say it was not going to be on premise. Lastly, the charge was for SELLING alcohol. All of the folks in attendance and whom have posted know there would never be sold without lisensure.

To use a movie review as an excuse to dredge up what amounts to a liberal conceit, with no basis in reality, is particularly offensive.   Since the 'reviewer' raised the issue, it's worth mentioning: while systemic ""White-racism"" went extinct decades ago, this nation is afflicted with an epidemic of Black-on-White, and Black-on-Asian violence, which goes carefully unreported by the mainstream media.

If you do not trust the school to make decisions with the welfare and success of all its students in mind, maybe it's not the right place for your student.    As for the ""8 missed classes"" policy, it sounds like that's based on absenteeism rather than a suspension.  But I think if my child had emotional or academic struggles, I'd be overjoyed to have his case looked at independently of policy.  All situations are different, and no one size fits all.

If he is not a threat, then how far should the school go in sharing his personal information with others?

But we just weren't told ANYTHING. Not a word. All we knew was that one student had been out since before Winter break. The kids believed it was for things in addition to the hit-list (things that have no place being listed on this forum.)  They were told by a teacher that the student was coming back and any questions and concerns were to be taken up with administration. However, the parents weren't told anything.   We know the school wants the best from and for all students. They are incredible educators. I want to go to school there! We like Mary a lot.

Unlike what many people who are new to this town believe or presume, its really not about racial ""diversity"" or a level playing field, but rather, its about who you know, how much money you have and which upwardly mobile white male will endorse you. Trouble is, people are influenced by image and Sean Davis has a powerful, ""Every Man"" image that may prove to be extremely effective to common folks.  Before the Forum on Arts Council and WW presume that Sean Davis is not a real contender, they'd better do some research. My prediction is that Sean is a major contender and has a very good chance of becoming our next mayor. This snub only confirms that the racism, & classicism is alive and well in this town."

What happens when people start using your yard as a restroom or a shoot-up locale? I suspect a fence would go up immediately.  Compassion goes both ways. And it has a lot to do with respect.

0,"A brief history to provide some perspective: McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk. In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed. The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums.  Naito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on Portland’s growth into a unique and desirable city. Ref: bit.ly/23xnfC9 Ref: bit.ly/23xnD3L"

Adults should be able to consume whatever they want to behind closed doors when they consent by free will.    Alcohol is an intoxicant, and the OLCC treats it like a vice and a commodity.    Cannabis is an entheogen and a vitamin and food.  The OLCC has literally no jurisdiction to mandate that a simple plant can't be consumed along side alcohol.  Assuming adults don't operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, they harm nothing by enjoying any range of substances.

He went on to say that choices have consequences.  The choice was made to not exercise any more patience on the matter.  Many in leadership at the federal level pleaded with all to not do what they did.  They asked them to simply continue to stand down and exercise patience.  It was believed that in time a peaceful resolution could be realized.  The sheriff went on to justify law enforcement's decision with the need to bring peace to the county.

The issue comes down to the fact that a student was out for a month- some parents know why, others don't- but the parents of certain kids sought answers that were not forthcoming. Unfortunately it took whoever DID go to the media for the school to respond to parent and student concerns. They are trying to now and the kids are all moving forward together.   To answer your question, yes. Everyone involved went through the appropriate pathways: peers,  (parents), teachers, dean, then head of school.

The Condos were and probably still are the cheapest way to buy in downtown with included parking and amenities like the pool/hot tub.    That being said I was not some rich person trying to shut off access to a public lake.  Comparing this to the Lake Oswego situation is almost a non sequitur.  I personally found needles in the very private raised area of the Condo Complex.  I think that would be alarming for anyone to find in their un-fenced back yard (where kids, dogs or you in sandals could be walking).   I don't necessarily agree with this situation (locking the gates) but the Condo owners pay a lot of money to maintain a green-way and pier structure so  perhaps a little less vitriol would be in order.

He went on to say that choices have consequences. The choice was made to not exercise any more patience on the matter. Many in leadership at the federal level pleaded with all to not do what they did. They asked them to simply continue to stand down and exercise patience. It was believed that in time a peaceful resolution could be realized. The sheriff went on to justify law enforcement’s decision with the need to bring peace to the county. I cannot imagine the level of panic and anxiety that was there, but I can assure you it was aggravated by the hype observed in the public arena. This tragic end could have been avoided."

If a land is not left open and unenclosed, or if a government action forbids a particular use, then the land is no longer free.  Multiple acts have been passed since 1890, most importantly the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, that regulate grazing on public lands and requires ranchers to pay a fee for those rights.

Secondly, no claim was made that it is not a designated greenway. Had you followed the link above you would have seen that it is zoned RXdg. Since you don't seem to fully read what you are looking at, I will simplify it. The RX is Central RESIDENTIAL. The ""d"" and ""g"" are overlays zones. The ""g"" is greenway and that gives the public the right to access the pathway as a park with many restrictions, like time of day, type of use and  type of vehicle (no skateboards, rollerblades, motorized vehicles). It is the responsibility of the condo property owners to maintain the path and they do, that is why the property is clean and tidy, while just the other side of the fence is one of the most trash filled and dangerous areas in the city. The city maintains that area. It is private property and the HOA can shut it down for purposes of repair, etc."

You will see that it is private land with a public access overlay. That means that the public can use it only during designated times of day, only for certain purposes, and only the path itself is open to the public. There are certain circumstances that allow the HOA to close the path, for instance it is allowed for maintenance and/or repair.  Please, let's move on to solutions to the real problems here. In the time it took you to post the same comment repeatedly, you could have done proper research. The HOA closed the path because that area has gotten way out of control, and a sense of lawlessness has taken over. There have been muggings, stabbings, rampant theft, public deification, littering and drug abuse. What would you propose to do about that?"

And then there is the issue of having to explain her numerous bar complaints, her partner Hook's ""Diversion Agreement"" with the Oregon State Bar, the stories of heartbreak and loss from thousands eager to share them, and the, er, ""curious"" nature of a non-profit that took in close to around one million dollars over the course of about 8-9 years and yet seemingly provided no services except running their own money-losing CLE programs.

There is no logical reason why men would need to use condoms or get a vasectomy as you recommended because drinking by the male is not known to impact the baby or health of the sperm significantly, although it is known to have an impact on health of the adult overall and that might impact DNA and sperm quality..  Also the affordable health care act made birth control free including IUDs for all women regardless of poverty so the CDC is already giving it out for free.

This police report reflects a snapshot of a frantic day for 2 caring parents and a child.  Furthermore, the minor child's private behavior has no place in the news.  As the pollster Mr. Horvick implies, this story is deeply unfair to Mr. Emmons, his ex-wife and especially his son, a minor at the time.

For those ""uniquely ready"" to receive the gospel—that is, those living towards death who find in the ecstasy of worldly pleasure an annihilative corollary—the Christian faith, with indiscriminate cruelty, opens the present as a wound that it will always prevent from healing. As a result of this wound, we can never look back, only forward, to the null point of impossibility. You, my friend, miss what is significant here: the eschatology of Judgment Day, far more than atheism, is a nihilistic refusal of messianic time. Where the latter might at least emancipate us to find our own salvation in history, the former lays history (and thus Portland) to waste."

To lay innuendo on an allegation of a door closing, that never rose to a charge by police, let alone a judgment by a judge or jury of his peers, is disingenuous. Parenting we know is a tough job. Stuart and his former wife have produced an exemplary young man. Stuart has been a tireless advocate for Portland Public Schools, and his son attended a Portland Public High School.

0.1,"It's not exactly ""breaking news"" that chronic absenteeism is a major issue in schools.  Nor is it news that it has a devistating impact on school success.  I'd predict any study of ""drop outs"" would indicate that the ""dropping out"" was preceded by a period, often a very long period, of such absenteeism.  The education committee's directing the Department of Education to ""come up with a plan"" to reduce chronic absenteeism is, in my opinion,  many, many days too late, and likely, many, many dollars too short.    Chronic absenteeism is not a ""problem"".  It's a manifestation of the many issues and problems those ""absent"" students face.  Personal substance abuse? Parental substance abuse? Physical, sexual or mental abuse at home? Economic issues at home?  ...in fact, all of those issues which impair stability and lead to dysfunction.  We're not talking about a ""school"" problem, we're talking about serious ""life"" and ""family"" problems which are being manifested in absenteeism."
0,"Hugh, thanks so much for letting us know! I'm going to do more tests on Chrome right now; I'm so glad you were able to log in using Safari.   Indeed, a lot of people do avoid commenting because they fear being verbally attacked or threatened. Hopefully our system is a step in the right direction; we'll keep working to improve it! We really appreciate the feedback."
0,"This is a great change.  I've often thought of these boards as a microcosm of downtown Eugene.  Open to all, but a small group harass and intimidate others to the point they no longer want to visit.   I welcome and enjoy reading points of views that differ from my own, and I appreciate the extra information given by knowledgable commenters, but the constant snark and anger was tiring, to say the least."
0,It will be great to see more thoughtful discussion in the comments. Hopefully the Oregonian picks up the same or similar system because they have it the worst right now when it comes to trolls.

0,It's probably better if we just forgot about them until their investigation is over and bears results.
0,"Downtown is going to build up, guaranteed, so we need to get creative about how we display and feature street food. The continuity of traffic and attention that the pods get is super-important, and I think you could find ways to replicate that feel, even in the context of a new high rise. I'd love to see leased micro-brick-and-mortar bays (a la ActivSpace's ground floor retail) in some of the new developments downtown, with rents sufficiently competitive to attract food cart folks or other culinary pop-ups. Shoot, you could even create a ""parallel parking"" row for food trucks & carts."
0,"Typo correction is a tricky thing for us, since we rely on peer moderation.  What if someone were to write a perfectly civil comment, get it through peer review, and then use the edit function to write something really nasty or threatening? Or what if they first write something like, ""Dog food tastes awful,"" get a ton of affirmative replies, and then edit it to say, ""Dog food tastes great""?   One option would be to put each corrected comment through the full peer-review process, but that would mean you'd need to rate three comments every time you wanted to correct a spelling error, which isn't a great experience.  This is one reason we give you the editable text field one last time when you're asked to rate your own comment (the other reason is that you might reconsider what you've written, having just been through the review process for other people's comments!)  Any further thoughts on this are very welcome! We're new and have a ton of updates on the way."

0,"I am concerned that info or opinions that do not fit the norm or status quo could be seen as incongruent or subverting predominant paradigms and be targeted for removal. Investigative research seems to be the exception at this period of history with sound bites and 140 character comments trumping meaningful exchanges in many platforms. It would be optimal for commenters to be able to read items deleted stored in a separate area - the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Will censorship of innovative or uncomfy info result from this mandatory civility model?   It will be edifying to see if substantial exchanges matriculate. This format limits characters - it is unusual for comments to be extensive, but for the historian/ scholarly participant, limiting characters may not be optimal. It no longer is a forum for substantial citizen journalistic discussion, only permitting comments on mainstream journalism, the writers oft rated by # of clicks by some rags. Disqus only lasted 90 days."

0,"Re ""whatever happened to Disneyland"" I was curious and looked it up. It started with Phil Simms after the Super Bowl in 1987. He got either $75,000 or $50,000 for saying ""I'm going to Disney World"" in the same situation that Payton Manning used to plug drinking beer. Comments for money is not a new thing. Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Magic Johnson ... an honor roll of sports stars did the Disney World thing, as recently as in last year's Super Bowl, when Julian Edelman and Malcolm Butler both did it.   I'm not shocked or horrified. As you point out, we're used to him selling us already. But what interests me with this is that it's going to bite him back. These days we are all more skeptical, and while the Disney World comments were taken without a lot of criticism, the beer plug sparked a fury in social media. It's not fee anymore, in the sense that his value goes down as he sells himself so blatantly. There's a zero sum game in there somewhere."
0,"Notapenny - I contacted Civil and they assured me that everyone would get equitable moderation treatment.   I'm gonna try it and if it doesn't hold up, their business model will be proven wrong and they will fail.  They seem to have removed the human bias element from the moderation equation and that can be seen as leveling the field for the  Conservative minority vs the old Disqus protocol that favored the Progressive majority.  I'm anxious for this to work.   DR"

I just thought it showed the stupidity of the posters. I suppose it scared away some timid souls, to be reviled for being a feminazi or a liberal posting agit-prop.  I worry, since Eugene is a liberal town, that conservative comments, no matter how civil, will be voted down. And what is this algorith? Is it like Carnivore, looking for nasty words like the fword, mf, etc?"
0,"That seems odd for someone posting using a screen name to want people to use real names. So I disagree with your comment, and I was under the impression that we would have a way to mark it as such, but I'm not seeing that. And I'm not going to flag it, although others certainly will flag posts they disagree with. None of it is a big deal, I'm just trying to get used to the system."
0,"If  ""honesty"" trumps transparency, why not apply that the same standard to LTE by permitting anonymous letters and anonymous op-eds?  I fully understand the fear that your words could be used against you, but that fear would help accomplish the goal you are trying to accomplish with this new system.  People will comment in a more thoughtful intelligent manner if they know that their name will be there next to their words for others to see.  I've been told by people more experienced with this stuff that one of the primary reasons the RG and others permit anonymous commenting is because that equates to more users, more clicks, and increased opportunity for advertising revenue.  Is that true?"

Because then Californians will move into those spots instead of moving into the currently more affordable spots.  More people want to live in Portland than the current housing stock can handle.  If you don't build more units, prices just go up even more quickly."
0,"I like the way Coach Altman looks at the Pac-12 standings and the respective team's remaining home & away games.   He thinks like a  winner and has imparted that philosophy to his players.   Bearing injuries to key players, I think the Ducks can go deep into the Big Dance this season.  In fact, with breaks, they could win it all.  After all, we are due.

To be fair you either have to add in all the savings for retirement and medical treatment in old age or in case of loss of income, or exclude payroll taxes from the discussion of tax burdens.  A much more sophisticated analysis can be found at http://www.kotlikoff.net/node/541, which I have not yet read, but a summary appears in the Oregonian today under “The True Measure of Economic Equality in the U.S.” by Clive Crook.

We can't simply decide we don't like this revenue source without looking at the implications of scrapping it."

I meant ""we"" in the citywide, civic sense - does Portland care, or not, about the travel/tourism benefits of having a nationally recognized street food scene, and if so, what are we going to do about the potential displacement of downtown pods? I think that the Food Cart Alliance has some (limited) pull with the city, but you're 100% correct that the developers are under no obligation to listen to any proposal from the broader ""we."" Removing parking spaces so that food carts can live on the street also seems like a non-starter, but that's an opportunity for the civic ""we"" to weigh in."

The two are incomparable.  So while I see where you're coming from, accusing them of hypocrisy, I hope you can see where that may not be the slam-dunk you imagine.

What I do know (from personal experience) is that after several rounds of the above, the reputation of the poster who has the truth to fall back upon (me),  tends to result in one of two typical outcomes: 1) When the mods are honest and the forum is impartial, the liars tend to get banned, until they assume new monikers.  2) The mods ignore the lies, (maybe) ask the abusers to stop the duplicate posts, or freeze the threads with the lies in place and the rebuttals frozen out."

0,"""Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.""  I think it is outrageous for the writer to make this claim.  Lead poisoning is tolerated because by and large it is invisible and is not routinely detected.  Until a few years ago, copper pipe used to disperse water throughout our buildings was joined with lead containing solder.  Probably most houses in the country have lead in their pipes.  When water is not used often lead from the solder can dissolve and reach appreciable concentrations.    The big thing about lead is that it takes really high doses to produce obvious symptoms.  To some extent low dose exposures are not obviously connected to harm.  The whole subject is controversial.  Run your water a bit before drinking it to flush the high lead content out."

Remember a few years ago the guy who threatened his ex, was charged with assault and other violent crimes against her, was released due to overcrowding (meaning the people that were not released were charged with even more serious offenses), got out and promptly killed the ex?

A strapped electorate won't vote for taxes, Lane County absolutely has to have certain funds in order to survive.   It is obvious that Lane County needs to put a lot of effort into bringing a large company into the area, one that can actually pay taxes instead of apply for relief from them.

I think objectively we or a jury can never know the truth in cases like this, the jury will most likely be voting their prejudices and personal world views.  You know a grand jury is a rubber stamp and an indictment via them carries no special validation.  Grand juries approve what 99 +% of indictments sought?  When it goes to trial, the trial jury will hear a person charge another with crimes having no physical reality in the current world.

0,"Each of us is unique.  Each of us sees the world differently.  Each person places transgressions of various kinds at different levels of significance.  In my own evaluation, murder is by far the worst crime followed by other crimes that do a person significant and long-lasting physical loss like shooting someone in the leg the treatment for which ends up requiring the loss of the leg.  I tend to place mental crimes at somewhat lower levels, mental crimes meaning that physical damage or loss is not the primary factor involved.  Many feel otherwise and place mental crimes right up there with murder.  In the present instance, however, I am trying to focus on how we know a crime has actually been committed.  A bullet in a leg provides dramatic confirmation of an event.  A story with no physical evidence is quite a different matter.  Serious thinking by all of us is required to understand the net good or bad done by our various policies.  I hope you have a pleasant day."

From the report, those figures are based on the numbers of probation/parole violations as a proportion of the *total* adult populations of each group. On the other hand, if you look at the numbers of violations as a proportion of the number of people in each group *already on probation/parole*, blacks are only 1.2/1.4 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively.   Of course, this is reconciled by noting that the proportions of the black population on probation and parole are, respectively, 3.4 and 5.5 times the corresponding proportions in the white population. Whether this fact is symptomatic of systemic racism is debatable, but this article seems to suggest that the disproportionality is *because* blacks are significantly more likely to violate probation/parole than whites, which misrepresents the report."

The rates at which each population violates probation/parole *they already had* are much more similar.  Also, you can't just add rates like that. That's not how math works.

0,"As a former basketball player at the high school and collegiate levels and a current coach, I can tell you this situation/conversation between players and coaches occurs on a weekly basis in high school gyms across the country. I.E a predominately African American high school team competes with a predominately Caucasian team. As it appears here, the coach's message was as it should be we are all the same.   If the allegations Ms. Wimmer has made were true, one would think that players, parents, coaches, and school administrators would be equally outraged. The other parents included in Ms. Wimmer's complaint declined to be interviewed. To me, this is a clear indication of a unhappy parental crusade to fire a coach because she feels her son was wronged in some way (PT, JV/Varisty selection, etc). Unfortunately this is now common place in the high school coaching arena and something nearly every coach has had to deal with. It just so happens in this case the coach's last name is Adelman."

The report also states they gathered data from at http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezapop/ - a visit to that particular URL says it's for Juveniles - so comparing an overall population ( census ) to Juvenile crime/jail data will bias your results to a much more volatile group ( youths ) that make much less intelligent choices ( youth )."
0.2,"Seems like a mixed bag. Without knowing what people are being arrested for, many of these numbers are meaningless. For example... if all the asians were arrested for trespassing and all the whites for murder, it would have a large impact on how you viewed the numbers.   It would be useful to see similar stats based on income levels, then compare the race numbers to the income numbers.  My point is that the less money you have, the greater the chance you're going to jail.   I have no doubt that being black probably adds a few percentage points on top of that, but the prime factor? I'm not so sure.  I spent my share of time with jail/prison/probation decades ago and I can assure you that the one thing almost everyone there had in common was a lack of money."

After Iowa and NH, Christi, Fiorina and probably Carson will drop out. No one is dropping out on the Dem., ticket yet as there are only 2 running. Considering that Bush, Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are vulnerable it has now gone from the unusual and odd to frightening that with such limited participation (10-12 States) andleaving out the majority of states from  input, that one of the choices for President could be someone who publicly calls other world leaders stupid.

0,"The Sierra Club Urban Growth Management Policy Guideline that “The local community should be actively involved in the review and design of their neighborhood” is key to the integrity of the rezoning process. That principle needs to be genuinely applied now. Resident organizations like South Willamette Neighbors (http://www.swneugene.org) and the Council of South Eugene Neighborhoods were recently formed to attempt to make this happen. Unfortunately, the City Planning department continues to maintain that the plan they wish to implement was “created by the community between 2011 and 2013” (see their website at https://www.eugene-or.gov/2675/South-Willamette-Special-Area-Zone), despite the outcry from the large number of potentially affected community members who never even heard of the plan until the past few months. While the City’s approach to community involvement was ill-conceived and ineffectual in the past, they can still show the courage and humility now to get it right."
0,"Yes, I was intending to compare both factors. Specifically, Table 13 of the report (p. 28) lists rates of violations resulting in a jail stay as a proportion of the population of each demographic on probation/parole, whereas Table 14 (p. 30) lists rates of violations resulting in a jail stay as a proportion of the total population of each demographic.   My main beef with this article is that it seems to suggest that black adults are jailed at a disproportionately high rate because black adults violate probation/parole (resulting in jail stays) at a disproportionately high rate (i.e., data that would be found in Table 13, which fails to show such a lopsided disproportionality), but instead relates the data from Table 14, which seem irrelevant without also taking into account the proportions of each population on probation/parole in the first place."

If this were ever passed by voters it would be because the population of Veneta/Elmira is greater than that of the rest of the area (unfairly stacking the votes!).  Besides all that, property taxes are an affront to basic human rights; you are taxed simply by not being homeless! Property tax is blind to the circumstances of the property - you could have two families who make identical wages, living in identical manufactured homes, but because one is on 120acres of farmland (which is also that family's source of income), they could easily be paying 10 times the taxes.. or more!

For example, he quotes the “Sierra Club Urban Growth Management Policy Guidelines” for the proposition: “new development should respect the character of the existing neighborhood.” Mr. McDonald conveniently leaves off the preface to the sentence, which said “Generally,” and also omitted the next two sentences: “Residential densities … must be sufficient to facilitate public transit and nonmotorized transportation and to achieve increased energy efficiency and affordability of housing.  Compact redevelopment should be promoted within one-half mile of high service transit nodes and corridors.” Of course, that leads one to the exact opposite conclusion that Mr. McDonald would have us believe that the Sierra Club supports because Willamette street and 29th is a high service node and corridor!"

0,"20, your comments cannot go unanswered.   I'll start with your handle. South Willamette St already IS a 20 minute neighborhood! It is quite functional, plenty of shopping, small houses, lots of trees. Your plan would replace it with high-rises, and row-houses. The dutiful forested neighborhood southwest of the intersection of 29th and Willamette would be destroyed. The only disagreement over this is in regards to how long it will take.  If we need more density on the urban area, there are two parcels that are crying out for redevelopment:  first, the abandoned EWEB facility, and second, all of south Glenwood.  Of course the latter is not quick and easy - replacing an existing neighborhood is far easier than building a new one."

0,"""perfect example of why those in the neighborhood alone cannot decide the fate of the"" South Willamette Area. Ouch - carpet-bag much? You should be aware that those of us who oppose this oppose it throughout the city: Coburg Road, River Road, Oakleigh Meadows, and all the other areas slated for replacement.  I should also point out that one of the primary mouthpieces behind this plan is a real estate developer who lives on 500 acres in Dexter - 4 times the area under consideration. Of course we don't know where you or the city planners behind this live: Spring Blvd? Fox Hollow? What is your 20 minute neighborhood?"

0,"Well your comment is very sad indeed:  you oppose something similar to the SW-SAZ plan throughout the city.  If your way prevails, Eugene will be stuck with its zoning and development ideas from the last century, including design standards.  Other places won't have 20-minute neighborhoods too.  That is really sad.  Fortunately, there are a lot of people who SUPPORT this plan throughout the city, and many live in South Eugene in an area that would impacted.  BTW, I own a house on College Hill, only several blocks off of Willamette and a similar distance from 29th.  I would be impacted and I still believe it is a great plan.  I want the neighborhood to benefit from this excellent plan, to lead the way in offering a more densely-populated walkable neighborhood (and not be left behind), to accommodate people who don't want to live in a house but may want a condo, to become more bike and walker friendly, to look better, and to assume responsibility for housing a share of new residents."
0,"Just to be clear, you understand that when I say 18 acres, I'm talking about the EWEB property, not Alton Baker?  Mike Clark had his Mayoral announcement speech there.  The thousands of people who could live on those 18 acres would have Alton Baker and its community gardens just across the bike/foot bridge.  They would have EMX Central to take them everywhere, multiple excellent grocery stores within walking distance, the silicone shire less than a 10 minute walk away, the hospital a 10 minute walk, the campus under 15 minutes.  The river and its world-class bike path right there.   Let's work on that first, and leave the Willamette neighbors solar lines alone for the moment."

0.2,"From your description, it appears that by ""mental crime,"" you mean one in which the victim's primary suffering is emotional rather than physical. While you are entitled to your opinion, your view that such crimes are inherently of lower severity is illogical.   It is well documented that emotional suffering does not occur in a vacuum. Victims of sex crimes frequently suffer ongoing physical symptoms resulting from their emotional anguish. Moreover, the pain debilitation from so-called mental crimes is real. When a rape victim loses the ability to enter or sustain intimate relationships or even work productively, the person has been disabled in a way that is analogous to a physical disability in terms of the impact and hardships involved.   Finally, the ""walk it off"" attitude inherent in minimizing sexual abuse as a second-class ""mental crime"" helps to perpetuate the notion that such crimes are somehow acceptable, if only by comparison. This notion, of course, is unacceptable."

I live in Elmira, about eight miles from Veneta. Veneta now contracts with the sheriff for a total of four deputies. Since Sheriff Trapp says it requires 5.2 FTE to assure 24/7 coverage (allowing for shift overlap, vacations, training, sick leave, other time away from patrol) Veneta actually has a little less than 24 hour coverage from one deputy seven days a week. That is roughly the same standard that is available in the county. However where I live, we have  three deputies providing coverage for the entire county (as observers noted about the size of Connecticut). Under the district proposal, my service would have increased substantially; the service in Veneta would have probably decreased, since the deputy on duty would have had a larger area to cover."

There is more of a danger from mercury in tuna than that posed by the release from a broken and carefully disposed bulb. In fact, the amount of mercury produced by burning more coal to power inefficient incandescent bulbs far outweighs any environmental impact from CFLs. Low wattage bulbs, including LEDs, reduce pollution from burning coal. Now a memory, this benefit came about after industry funded Republicans blocked legislation forcing the elimination of old technology filament bulbs, which are really just small heaters designed to also produce light.

Voting is a public good. Automatically registering citizens to vote does no harm. The state should make it as easy as possible for citizens to participate in elections. As citizens participate more, they will see the wisdom of informing themselves on the issues. This is exactly what anti-voting rights people fear. That people actually have a problem with making it easier for citizens to vote is a measure of the backward mentalites--extreme individualism, laissez-faire racism, anti-government paranoia--that prevail here and prevent American society from moving into the 21st century."

She'll more than likely be white, will, guaranteed, be a Christian. She'll, of necessity, have to be against abortion rights, and will no doubt be an extreme fiscal conservative. In the eyes of younger Democratic-leaning women, Bernie's pure and untainted. What they don't seem to realize is Sander's political purity is a function of his former political irrelevance. Hillary Clinton has never been politically irrelevant. She's a political pugilist. This scares certain types of women.

0,"Yours is just one example of many why we simply should not have a tax based on a volatile and subjective value of one's property.  You pay more simply because you invested your money (that you already paid taxes on) in your home or land - which increased in value because of factors outside of your control.  Spend $100,000 building a boat, you pay no taxes on that.  If you spend $100,000 building a home on your land, you pay thousands of dollars in taxes, year after year.  You're better off with a 500sqft home and a 2000sqft yacht drydocked on your property.  Even though that sounds absolutely awesome, how much sense does it make?  Real estate is the only thing you get taxed on after you own it. It's the only thing you pay extra taxes on if you improve it while you own it. It's the only thing that has its value determined by the ones collecting the taxes.  Housing is also a basic human need.

If anyone has claim other than the Feds, it would be the local indigenous population, who have made clear they don't support the terrorists.

Since it's so easy to vote in Oregon, X Malcolm seems to think the right to vote in Oregon is ""not worth having"" for him, I suppose. Fortunately for him, in Oregon he need not use his right if it's ""not worth having."" It will keep his ballot crayons sharp."

We don’t require photo ID, and we don’t have polling places to limit the number of. As I wrote before, it’s easy to register and easy to vote. We didn’t need a motor voter law.  Back in our days of polling places, they would sometimes hand out “I voted” stickers. That would be something to take pride in: I studied the issues and candidates to some degree and made an educated choice, then went to the polling place and waited in line to make that choice.  Nowadays, you can simply print at home, “I filled in the arrows.” The less literate might scribble “I filed in the eros” on a piece of paper and Scotch-tape it to their T-shirt. They may take a lot of pride in knowing that filling in the arrow next to the D means they can keep their Oregon Trail card. At least that’s what the league of women voters person told them."

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

The 'Skousen' version of the Constitution displayed prominently in the front pocket of all the Bundy criminals (they are not 'protesters' if they are heavily armed) does indeed advocate overthrow of all Federal authority.

Eastern Oregon was a dust bowl in the 1930's: the Refuge was created in part to prevent futher environmental devastation. The Bundy idiots and their militia supporters are the 'not so bright' wing of the far right in the US who want public lands belonging to all of us  opened to mining, logging, and grazing which would cause irreversible damage to the environment for short term profit for a few.

Because gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces, it takes truly massive objects to make gravitational waves we can detect.

If method employed is observed to lead to unfortunate results, it is profitable to examine that method and determine whether changes could reduce or eliminate unfortunate results observed.  The LE tactic of immediate confront and control is very widespread and precludes calm and careful evaluation of unknown situations which you point out they routinely encounter.

By the way, the construction of two detectors was not just to validate detection as in duplicate.  Gravity waves travel at the speed of light which is fast but not instantaneous.  The signals observed at the two detectors are thus delayed copies of each other.  The time delay signifies traveling gravity waves and even helps determine the direction from which they came."

Not just Walmart but Winco, Walgreens, & Guaranty, and on down the line.  As for gas for your car, maybe there is still a small one owner station with sales under $25 million but he for sure be buying from a distributor who will be adding it to his sales.  Second, unlike an actual sales tax with provisions for resale - to prevent double taxation - the corporate sales tax could easily multiply. A grocery store often buys from local businesses, the local beverage distributors for instance. Their 2.5% increase would be added to Safeway's 2.5% increase."

Thus if we impose a higher corporate tax, the affected companies will immediately raise prices to maintain their profit margin or, if they cannot, they will go out of business or stop doing business in the state of Oregon.  Thus the corporate tax is simply a sneaker tax to extract money from John and Jane Q. Public citizens of Oregon.  Perhaps the corporate tax to help schools would be good.

So you are saying that a scientist does not understand science.  Okay, but I have fooled my peers.  Regarding ID,  it is a hypothesis which presumes that life forming processes did not proceed randomly (which is presumed in standard evolution models) and that instead processes are driven by an ordering force or factor which falls outside current scientific models.

0,"Oregon is fortunate to not be like most athletic programs requiring tens of millions of tuition dollars be spent subsidizing the arms race of those programs.   However, it is worthwhile to consider that football makes a lot of money and spends a lot of money--the two are not completely intertwined. Every football program in the country could agree to spend no more than $2 million dollars a year on head coaches, and tax athletics for 10% of TV revenue and they would all be running break even and the football programs would be just fine. Likewise, the foundations that court donors could offer season tickets for donations to any part of the university rather than just athletics, or do a better job of showing potential donors how their dollars could help with other programs.   I think tax-exempt organizations also have a responsibility to show restraint rather than funneling money that could be taxes to very high personal salaries."

Those businesses with lots of entry level jobs will cut staffing to keep expenses in line with income. Regardless of the minimum wage level, no business stays open long without profit.  That's the system we currently live with.  The new minimum is actually too low to cut public assistance for any but single member households.  A single and parent with one child, or a childless couple will still make less than the 185% of the Federal poverty level.

0,"After forcing the Paiute tribes off the lands, another example of federal government abuses, FDR proclaimed the lake area as a wildlife refuge of approx..80,000 acres. After the Natives were forced into reservations and the refuge was made some of the surrounding lands were purchased by homesteaders/Ranchers. Little by little the refuge was expanded to what it is now approx..185,000 acres. During those decades ranchers were basically forced to sell the land relocate and purchase grazing rights. The whole point of my argument is that once some purchases any lands it should be there's to decide what to do with it. Selling at fair market value would be appropriate. Forced to sell at 10% value should not be acceptable. Our Constitution is continually altered to suit the government's desires, not we the people's. These latest land issues are in response to the fed govt. expanding the size of Nat. Forests, Wildlife Refuges and Nat. Parks. Time will tell the truth, follow the money trail."

No ID proponent has a problem with microevolution, because it is statistically possible, (2 base pair mutation in single celled and single mutational event, in a mammal, for example).  These are entirely expected, the math supports it. Was cannot be supported, are multiple mutations required for a Selectable Advantage, this is certainly a requirement for macro evolution. Much recent work has revealed many Latent genetic and regulator instructions, in all life, that change the organism when stressed.  The changes follow a predictable pattern, when creatures are stressed in the same manner. The Evolution Revolution, by Lee Spetner, lists many specific examples of this. What appears to be going on, are environmental adaptations brought about, by built in information, not the gradual accumulation of micro evolution.  Reality suggests, creatures preloaded with information."

So to stop that we instead have a system where 90% of the schools transfer money directly from student tuition to athletic departments when they transfer money for subsidies.

Since the U of O isn't attracting enough scholars to keep their 1969 reputation in research and keep losing the scholars who are generating the academic grants to other universities, I think that is what the academics and administrators who aren't going to get any of that sports money should be worrying about.  The Legislature keeps reducing the funding, the U of O now has the authority it asked for to go get its own money, now is the time to fix what needs fixing on the academic side if they are capable of doing so.  If not, we need to identify why not and fix that."

Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza.   Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.

When the PLO was founded in 1964 their aim was not the creation of lands under Egyptian (Gaza) and Jordanian (West Bank) authority, but rather the elimination of Israel and the founding of an Arab Palestinian state encompassing the entire area - sans Jews.  Soon after, in 1967, at the Arab Summit in Khartoum, leaders of every Arab state attending determined and have since hewed to: No recognition of Israel, No negotiating with Israel, No peace with Israel.   Unlike Mr. de Klerk, Israel has no [partner with which to discuss peace.  Seems to me, it's much easier than going to war. . . again."

So the chance of two mutations is 1/300 x 1/300 and the chance of 6 mutations is (1/300)^6, or 1 in 79 trillion. But the number of bacteria on earth is 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, so 6 billion bacteria will have 6 new mutations arising at any time. Given a generation time of 20 minutes, that is searching a lot of genome space every year. This doesn't even take into account that there are 6 billion billion bacteria with 2 mutations arising at the same time, and most of these will pass those mutations on to the next generation, allowing 2 additional new mutations to arise in 6 billion of those, and then 6 bacteria to have all 6 new mutations after just 3 generations.

For example, he basically read into the AAA, a view that the originally narrow statute (originally written to only apply to union arbitration) now trumps most statutes passed by both state and federal legislatures intending to give people their day in court.  Many knowledgable people now say his opinions on the AAA have pretty much slammed the door on employee and consumer access to the courts.  In my personal view, Justice Scalia was a radical activist judge.  Not saying that's a bad thing, but please, let's call a spade a spade.  As nice as it sounds, he was NOT a pure Constitutional originalist.  He was a conservative activist judge who acted like a ""quasi-legislator,"" at least in some cases."

The close proximity of two very different wage standards will always encourage migration across a border.....both legal and illegal.  That's not news.

The ""major questions"" about evolution.....Simple, it doesn't fit with the conservative Christians' literal interpretation of the Bible.  Those ""major questions"" have nothing to do with the extensive evidence supporting evolution, but are a result of the cognitive dissonance that evidence creates for the ""faithful,"" and, of course, given a choice between denying all that evidence and questioning beliefs you faithfully follow, many conservative Christians have chosen to deny evolution.

0,The disturbing trend of adding no legal/judicial review clauses to laws is now a commonplace tactic to obstruct protection of wolves and public support of them. Currently two riders/bills with no judicial review clauses are circulating. They attempting to delist wolves in the Western Great Lakes and Wyoming. Both riders/ bills followed a federal district court judge ruling that found agency actions arbitrary and capricious and inadequate to protect wolves. Delisting is generally prompted by the livestock or sports hunting industry. Even more unfortunate is that when delisting occurs the state legislatures immediately push for wolf hunting despite public protest and against the advice of independent scientists. There is clear evidence that national constituents do not favor wolf hunting and that they wish to see wolves protected. When the USFWS proposed a national delisting more than 1.6 million comments were received! Riders with no judicial review clauses violate democracy.

Sure, people still need to look both ways, but your accusation that they have ""blind trust"" blames the pedestrian when they have the right-of-way. As far as saying, ""Until that changes, we’ll probably hear more tragic news."", it is not a ""tragedy"" if the system is designed without adequate safety.

The rebel, the loner, the critic, and the lover are some others.     I liked LaVoy's soft spoken ways coupled with his hard edge.  The letter was meant as a tribute.

In addition to the 70 employees look at the other jobs; I  imagine this mill needs at least  25 loads of logs a day - that's at least two to three logging crews of  about 10 per crew. Five log trucks making 5 runs a day plus the employees that service the trucks add another seven and I think they are up to 100 jobs.  Now look at Josephine County's income - if the logs average $4000 per load they get 1/3 of that from the Forest Service or $1300 per load x 25 loads per day x 5 days per week x 40 weeks = $6.5Million.

Putting aside how one defines ""long tradition"" that long tradition of not nominating runs into an even longer tradition: following the Constitution.

0,The court's conservative decisions have been more firmly rooted in the traditional role of the court in reviewing and interpreting existing law.  Obama's use of the EPA to regulate a non-toxic material like CO2 was always a stretch and pretty clearly outside the range of activities envisioned by enabling EPA legislation.  The court did not so much block Obama's efforts as say that EPA's enabling legislation gives it no power to regulate non-toxic materials.  Liberal tilting decisions have been substantially more legislative in nature such as the same-sex marriage matter.  The constitution is fundamentally silent on the matter and the court's decision comprised entirely new law.  For the unelected court to legislate is fundamentally outside the operation of a government of the people and more closely resembles the days of royal proclamation.

The changes – liberal, conservative, those you or I like and those we don't – are a vital part of a brilliant constitution. You can complain about them – we all have that right, and I hate some of the recent ones too – but let's not forget that our system needs courts, and interpretation, to survive.

That’s right, 80% below the status quo. Remarkable. It is a tribute to our “You don’t mess with my bureaus I won’t mess with yours” commission form of city government.   The current FY 15/16 road repair budget is $11,400,000. That is 20%, that’s right, a pitiful 20% of what is required to simply maintain Portland’s current 12% street repair deficit. That’s astonishing. That means that over the last 30 years the Portland city council has siphoned off 80% of the available and necessary street maintenance budget for their own self-indulgent, politically self-promoting pet projects.

In both examples, the changes were effected via amendments; the 13th prohibited slavery and the 19th provided universal suffrage. No ""interpretation"" on the part of any court was needed. In my opinion, constitutional interpretation is a slippery slope. After all, anyone, including a judge, can interpret any constitutional clause any way he or she wants even if totally detached from logic and reality. (Perhaps we've seen this?) Rather, Judge Scalia's tenets of texturalism and originalism are what's needed; close adherence to the original meaning and intent of the Constitution. If it's clauses are no longer relevant and do not serve our nation, the proper and more difficult course is to amend the Constitution rather than take the less difficult path of interpretation."

Obviously, not the case since the Court is seen by both major parties as a means to extend the political influence/philosophy of the party in control of the Administrative Branch, the President at the time of vacancies.

Each one played high school and college football, and probably youth football, too; each was subjected to practices and standards that would be considered much more barbaric and dangerous from his playing days when compared to what occurs now. Each is a testament to the obvious, that not everyone who plays the game ends up damaged for life.  In fact, rare is the football coach who did not play the game himself. In Oregon's case, each of these 10 individuals now earns, when incentives are factored in, more than the president of the United States.

""  Mind you, this was her response to Brentwood-Darlington's  concerns about meth use and human waste on the Springwater Corridor.  In another forum on homelessness,, the Oregonian noted that she talked about ""breaking down silos"" instead of anything specific.  Now she sets a deadline and then blows it.  C'mon now.  This from someone who screwed up her taxes over a course of years.

0,"Me?  I have a very specific view of what is important and what is less important.  In my world view, injuries to another person's body are top crimes.  Murder is at the top and I wouldn't oppose capital punishment for premeditated murder.  Murder itself comes in various types, premeditated, unintended in a fight, etc.  Murder generally is worst and lengthy sentences are appropriate to prevent it.  Injury, especially with permanent consequence is next and warrants five year type sentences and the high cost they entail.  Simple property crimes are actually pretty inconsequential.  I'd set sentences at 6 months or so for a $915 bank robbery.  If serious physical assault requiring real medical treatment had occurred, then it would be the physical injury charge that would lead.  I tend to judge the ""crime"" by its true consequence rather than its transient emotional irritation.  $915 is just not such a big deal and simple property crimes warrant at most 10x  the loss in public cost."

We know very little about Lucy Vinis, other than that she appears not to have any experience being an _elected_ official.  To me, it is quite clear that she was recruited by Piercy, Alan Zelenka and Claire Syrett; and the three of them will control Vinis every move as a ""proxy"" for Piercy.

0,"Well, I would say that the severity of their reactions comes from a failure of the bank to provide adequate training as to proper procedure and response.  Since human life is far more valuable than a thousand dollars, tellers should cooperate and be taught non-provoking responses.  Banks should organize procedures so that minimal cash is available.  If a teller was injured, then the injury crime should lead.  We would be better off if we organize punishment so as to escalate with negative consequence.  Give a robber 5 years for taking a little cash, there is little incentive not to injure bank personnel since punishment will not escalate much.   I am sorry, but we as a society have to realize the difference between being emotionally distressed on a temporary basis and serious physical harm.  To fail to recognize the difference in sentences means perps will have little or no motivation to refrain from real permanent physical assault including murder."

I'm not sure the city needs something separate. If the city decides that camping isn't allowed in that particular spot it can have the people move to a place where camping is permitted, correct? Also, given that camps have to follow the policies laid out by the city and will be monitored by a camp host, I figure the campers will have to adhere to the rules or move along.

0,"Oregon Democrats deliberately chose to overload the short legislative session to preclude a deep analysis of their proposed legislation. This round includes many gifts to their special interest lobbies, evidence by the $100,000 Gov. Brown received to fast-track the minimum wage legislation. The Oregon GOP is absolutely justified in using any delaying tactics at their disposal. This editorial is empty rhetoric. The short session was designed for emergencies that arose during the recession of 2009, not to push controversial bills through without due deliberation. This is a shameful abuse of power by Oregon Democrats, and they should be made to pay at the ballot box."

You comment addressing ""encouraging"" them involves finding a parking spot, going back to the individual and engaging them in a conversation.  Most motorists are going somewhere and simply don't have the time to engage with every panhandler they see.  Additionally, don't assume that every homeless and/or destitute individual wants to have a conversation with you.    Your comparison to a stranded motorist or an injured animal is specious.  I and, I guessing, you have altered my plans, called and postponed an engagement, etc. so I could help a stranded motorist.....very different thing.  As I mentioned, if Springfield, Eugene or anyone else is truly interested in traffic safety, they should focus on enforcing those ""no talking on cell phones and no texting"" laws........rather than attacking panhandling."

That's probably where most people will be if a near big one (8.0+) strikes. CA has a requirement that pre-1960 homes come with some type of earthquake assessment when they're sold. Here it's buyer beware.  As houses are sold, an earthquake risk report should be required.   The real estate industry will balk at this suggestion but it should be a priority for safety committees.  Government can publicize the risk and offer educational workshops. Tax write offs and other incentives could help with remediation.

Vinus, Clark and maybe Cassidy appear to be calling for more of the same: housing ONLY. A true housing first includes those next steps of substance abuse treatment and job training. No wonder we've got homeless people coming from far and wide to ""visit"" Eugene. We provide free food, very little to no enforcement of illegal camping violations (that foul our river), no enforcement of our no-drinking in public laws, free needles, free laundry, free clothes and even heated spaces if the temperature drops.

However, stopping your car to engage a panhandler and offering him or her an amount that made you feel really good about yourself might also encourage that person to stop panhandling, at least for the day. A win-win all around, having satisfied each other's quota. There are plenty of traffic laws that merit more attention, starting with the concept of a stop sign as something other than a mere suggestion. Keeping pedestrians out of traffic areas where they don't belong -- obstructing a bike lane, for instance -- is as good an idea as keeping motorists off their phones.  Funny that you would make a hierarchical distinction between a stranded motorist and a stranded soul as to which is worthy of going the extra mile to assist. Perhaps that reveals a more honest level of compassion. Thanks for the insight."

The good news is, even if the Springfield city council approves this ordinance, you'll still be able to give as much and as often as you wish to each and every panhandler you encounter when visiting that fair city. You'll just have to get out of your car to do it, or park and hail the stranded soul to approach your car. Should that inconvenience trump your quotient for compassion, you could always just throw the money on the ground and continue on your way, confident that your handout will be scooped up and save you the possible littering fine. By the way, those of us who don't live in Springfield really don't have any business telling those who do how to conduct theirs."

When police activities of any sort, let alone a shooting where someone dies, are allowed to be kept secret from public review, we risk abuse and tyranny. While it may seem prudent right now in this particular case, eventually a law like this in the hands of those who are entrusted with police power tends to become standard procedure. Once that happens abuse of the practice is certain to follow, and should it become widespread it becomes tyranny. It is a slippery slope.  Anyone who becomes a police officer knows what they sign up for when they take the job. Since this kind of thing happens rarely, the officer's name should still be released, but the officer and family should be protected as needed by moving them somewhere secure until the threat is sufficiently reduced. Yes, it is inconvenient, but only to a few. Tyranny, however, affects everyone and is not easily undone."

You may think that's a good idea, that's fine.  I don't think it's a good idea unless we're willing to provide those services and programs which would help the homeless and destitute find the care and assistance they need.

These people represent a clear danger to commit further criminal acts, including intimidation and violence.   To argue that this officer should have a target painted on his back, and his family to also then be allowed to also be targeted, is an argument that is extremely irresponsible for anyone to make.   Members of law enforcement do not sign up to become targets of terrorists.  When Muslim extremists attacked that Mohammed Cartoon event in Garland, TX 9 months ago, the name of the officer that killed both of the  extremists was withheld from the public, and was  never released.

The federal government is designed to protect and promote the welfare of the citizens of the united states.  My opinion is that I want the corruption to end. The taxpayers pay politicians salaries and pensions. Lobbyists and corporate donors give them additional money and side deals are made everyday.

That said, what bothers me a lot more than uncivility is the widespread American ignorance, even among college graduates, about public issues.

That is not possible to do by handing something out my car window. So my policy is to contribute to organizations who can vet those they give to, or I give to people who I have the time to personally vet or know.

""A true housing first includes those next steps of substance abuse treatment and job training.

For those who are, it's much more effective to offer such supports after they're safely housed. Being homeless is very stressful, which encourage the use of alcohol and other drugs to deal with it. Stress is also a trigger for mental illness. There is a lot of therapy in simply being safe. Plus it's the right thing to do. No one deserves to be without shelter.  It's a myth that Eugene attracts homeless people because it offers so many benefits. In fact, the city does not. The most important benefit for someone who is homeless is shelter, and we have only a small fraction of the needed shelter."

The question here is whether those we hire, provide training and firearms to, and then send out to protect the rest of us should be protected, at least for some period of time, from being targets of the crazy people or having their family members as targets of crazy people."
0.7,"Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them. This law subverts our ability to be watchful.  Conflating the civil disobedience of a group who has to date never hurt or killed anyone with radical Muslim extremists is nonsense, and most certainly not the same thing. Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.  While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods."

I think I will cut this short...and wait for the professional to actually, you know, provide some context to the title.   I, for one, do not find Donald Trump evoking nostalgia for either Bush president. He is the only one who called President W. Bush to task, for both 911 and the war crime of the second Iraq war.

I can appreciate the need to stay true to party lines, but to deny history? All are true: Clinton did not kill Bin Laden. Bush was president on 9/11. Obama made the decision to take out Bin Laden.

And she may be honest and authentic, but so are the other three candidates for mayor and thousands of other residents. After reading the description of her supposed polling experience, I don’t believe Laurie is one of those residents."

0,The article states that in 2005 the City of Portland began a 10 year to to end homelessness.  Eleven years later the homeless population is larger than ever.  I am curious as to what exactly the City of Portland was doing this last 11 years.  Large sums of money seem dedicated to the problem every year and obviously those dedicated funds have to come from somewhere but where is the accountability for those funds?  Additionally when you start setting up camps you have to commit to garbage services and probably portable restrooms.  Those services have to be paid for which means we the taxpayers have an additional burden on the tax dollars we spend and we are getting less services because we all know the homeless population aren't paying for any of the provided services.  Where exactly does all this stop?

0,"I actually work with these populations and can tell you that a larger percentage struggle with a disability of some sort, but more and more we are seeing people who are newly homeless or homeless for the first time. Often these are families who have been served a no cause eviction or sudden rent increase that forces them and their children out of their homes. The family shelter in east county is seeing 170+ family members a night. Last year this time, they were seeing 130 on a bad night. Two years ago, 100 was rare. Camping at least provides stability allowing for energy to be put towards other necessary tasks.   It is often overlooked how much additional work those who are homeless already do beyond the average housed individual. They have to find a place to sleep, places to use the restroom, places to shower, places to sit and rest without hassle. All these things we take for granted in our homes.

Much of the best riding in this area (in the state, for that matter) happens to not be on asphalt.   Of course, there's also the little fact that the bark trails are actually smoother than most of our bike paths, so the ride is actually more comfortable off-pavement.  That said, I don't have a problem with banning bikes from those paths. It would be nice if we would enforce state law regarding pedestrians on our bike paths while we're at it.

Yes, the men and women who sign on for the job know that they may at some point use the gun that comes with the job. Most often it's for protection. I doubt that any LEO expects to use deadly force. In the case of Finicum and the people rallying, raging about the incident, the officer deserves full protection, including concealing his identity."

Of course they do, and Apple is in no way hindering their search. They have simply been unsuccessful.   But that is not the problem. Apple has spent billions of dollars making a secure and easy to use product, something of high value and utility to virtually every one of their customers. They have done such a good job that now the government wants them to make a key so the security can be defeated. Once a key exists, the problem is one of keeping that key out of the wrong hands, which is infinitely more difficult to do than if the key does not exist and requires extreme technical knowledge and many millions of dollars in engineering efforts to produce. Nor will it only be used once; it will be used without end. And 1 billion Apple users will know that their data is less secure than before."

If you feel drone aircraft, alcoholic beverages and smoking should be allowed in public  parks, by all means work to have such restrictions lifted.

Who is going to front the insurance claims when peoples' vehicles inevitably get broken into? The city (*cough* taxpayers *cough*)? Or will they just deny that it was due to the homeless camp they created and it was just a ""random act""? Where are these people going to go to the bathroom? Where are their dogs going to go to the bathroom? They already defecate all up in the stairwells, this will just make it much worse.

0,"So it is not so much the government that is the concern, but that the key may be compromised allowing the bad guys access to your data. And if you doubt that is a threat, then I am sure you would be willing to remove all antivirus and anti malware protection from your computer and trust that nothing bad will happen.  Additionally, Apple's security feature not only wipes the phone's data but disables the device as a deterrent to theft. If the key ever gets out (and it will), your iPhones and iPads will once again be a prime target for theives.  Apple has every right to decline their services to aid the government in diminishing the value of their product to a billion users while permanently damaging their business opportunities. We all want to catch terrorists. But there are many other ways to do that without damaging security for everyone else and harming the value of Apple's business."

But it’s unlikely Lindholm surveyed her; the Register-Guard would not give Lindholm such credibility if his results were based on push-polling, and a Lindholm surveyor would have identified herself as such.  So what are the odds that another entity was push-polling the same week as Lindholm’s survey? I would guess they’re low.

We can't control littering, copulation, defecating in bushes, alcohol consumption, or drug use in the parks.  We can't even control sleeping in parks.  Because we can't outlaw homelessness.  If we seriously want to attack public smoking, then make it illegal in all public places.  And hire some more police to enforce it.  Other cities, including Seattle, have done that.  This ban targets homeless people unfairly."

Now that $200 an hour attorney's job (which doesn't include the cost of his office, advertising, staff, research time, etc.), that's something that requires a little effort to go for.

With twice the review space and three times the photos dedicated to a fan letter to Pizza Jerk, it's obvious where the author's loyalties lay before this review was ever written. It's also obvious that he's been to Pizza Jerk multiple times, and only once to Red Sauce. His defensive response to the person pointing out a glaring error in the reporting shows that he didn't bother to do his due diligence before putting out this fan letter to the ""Earl of Sandwiches"".    I read restaurant reviews to know what I can expect at a joint. This fan letter failed to deliver. Guess I'll have to check out Red Sauce myself. I'm not too keen to deal with the likely fanboy crowd at Pizza Jerk."
0,"Staging the World  Tack and Field Championship may lose money overall, but some well known folks will make LOTS of money in the process.   This will be a tremendous subsidy for the University of Oregon--$25 million to renovate and expand the UO track and field facility.  The UO Foundation could easily pay for this, but the UO trustees have plenty of clout to get those hotels and other lodging facilities along the coast to pay for it.  This project will bring great honor and profit to Nike (who got their own tax subsidies from the legislature) and to Vin Lananna. Certainly, Lananna will deserve a huge increase in compensation for organizing this dump truck full of money to pull up to Hayward Field.  But let's not forget the culpability of the local legislators for organizing this great game of Three Card Monte."

0,"Carl, if you are serious about actually having an impact on the costs to society of poor food choices it will be necessary to focus your zeal on all members of society and not just the poor who receive assistance from the SNAP program.  It's easy to bully the poor and blame them for all of society's problems but the reality is the poor quality of American food choices have to do with food access, and the poor are systematically disadvantaged in this regard. There are also many affluent people who make poor food choices. If you're serious you'll need to support measures such as warning labels on food, restriction on advertising, and health related taxes imposed on foods that fail to meet health criteria. Also, the issue of lack of access to quality food in poor neighborhoods will have to be taken seriously by the government."

To say that panhandling takes resources from other groups is a bit of a stretch, again I don't hear the reasoning behind this.   To say that panhandling has no basis in improving homelessness is factually incorrect.  I spent nearly 8 months working with SVDP to get an unhoused gentleman nothing more than a spot to park a trailer.   This gentleman is now in housing after 8 years. He receives a meager $576 a month and is legally blind. He relies on panhandling to pay his utilities and for other household necessities.  There is several gentleman near Gateway, one who is elderly and disabled, and a vet, who rely on this to stay indoors.   Many, many homeless with pets, disabled, and mentally ill, do not have the tools or transportation needed to access all resources, and resources for housing are little to none.

If, in fact, we were providing the services and support individuals need to help work their way out of homelessness and poverty, we'd be seeing far less panhandling.  We don't provide the facilities and programs destitute addicts and chronic alcoholics need to work on recovery.  We don't adequately provide the assisted living facilities for the developmentally disabled.  We don't adequately fund communty based programs for the mentally ill.  Our lack of care and support for our Veterans is a disgrace.  Affordable housing is woefully inadequate.  and on and on and on.

If not, then they need to step the hell up, and Portland needs to pitch a fit about that.  2) Are the laws regarding homeless issues similar from place to place? For instance I recall seeing signs preventing panhandling at on-ramps in Salem(?). If I want/need to beg for money I'd go somewhere else. Should Portland put in similar restrictions?   3) There _are_ people who just want to ""sleep rough"" (to quote OPB's Think Out Loud piece on Hazelnut Grove) - how do we steer our limited resources away from them and to the people who are truly in need?   I have no good answers, mind you."

0,"Being at Columbia University in physics in the 70's, I have to take issue with Isenberg's history.  There was little doubt in physicist's minds in the 1970's about black holes.  Without even getting into general relativity, it was clear that a suitably massive star simply could not by any known force avoid collapse to a singularity when no longer able to generate fusion power.  Also, Newton was essentially silent on gravity waves dealing rather with relatively stationary bodies.  If Isenberg had asked Newton what would happen if the sun were displaced by million miles in 10 seconds, I suspect Newton would have paused and speculated on a gravitational field distortion at large distances from the Sun that resembles gravitational waves.  Of course, we cannot ask Newton, but the point is that the analogy between the emission of electromagnetic (light) and gravitational waves is not so incredibly different.  Discarding Isenberg's history, of course detection of gravity waves is important."

Most of these aging road warriors would be better off in a hotel than a motor home.  I think the driver training and licensing standards should be re-evaluated for all motor home operators and trailer haulers.  As an aside, assuming these people had full coverage on the vehicle and trailer, if they received payment from their insurance company then that company has the right to bring any claim for property damage.  On that claim, and on their injury claims, there is certainly some comparative fault by the driver and I think the attorney has a conflict of interest representing the wife and not suing the husband too."

In relation to wars, we more realistically ascribe responsibility to the politicians who gave the orders.  When we discuss police actions, we get focused on the individual officers and not the policies that guide them.

0,"The best way to raise one's wage is to invest in oneself so as to be more valuable.  Self improvement is not easy nor cheap and may require deferment of pleasure.  Nevertheless, to get up above the bottom rung wherever that is pegged requires being worth more.  The current trend of simply bumping up the minimum wage is not based on increasing the quality or ability or training of the work force which might improve productivity and thus improve overall well being.  With no improvement in productivity, raising the minimum wage can only redistribute the wealth and the redistribution will mostly affect those who are just hanging in there.

Past increases in the minimum have been typically in the single digits of percent or at or at best slightly above inflation so this is moderate.   The opposite of major is minor so single digit increases in the minimum produce minor job loss.  What's currently proposed for the minimum is around a 50 percent increase, i.e. a major increase.

First - our startup incubators and accelerators are very new, so time will tell to show the full impact of these programs (though they've added 170 jobs in the last 18 months), but if we end up mirroring what the Kaufmann Foundation findings say about startups in America, then the majority of the net new job growth in our region will come from startups (firms under 5 years old): http://bit.ly/1oDlt2C.

The alternative is to appreciate how many motorists are simply stuck in their cars due to planning that requires sprawl.  Sure, there are those cyclists that are willing to ride 20 miles a day to commute or families that raise children without a car. But their exception should not be a critique of everyone who drives a car.  For the most part, people who bike really like it. No one has to ride on a rainy 35 degree day. But there is so much independence, exhilaration, and exposure to nature that for me at least, having to drive is the depressing experience. The best benefit is from riding those two miles that most people drive. A cold engine uses 30% more fuel but a two mile ride is doable."

0,"@outsider77 and @ScienceDuck  With respect, ‘limited impact’ and ‘not real job producers’ are characterization not consistent with the data.

The vast majority of these companies individually are small to mid-sized in terms of employment, but in total employ nearly 5,000 people. For reference, that total employment numer is ~25% larger than wood products, which is another important sector.  The tech sector not only has the highest average wage of any (total payroll ~$350,000,000), but was forecasted to grow faster than all other sectors: 19 percent between 2012 and 2022, compared to just 15 percent for all other industries. Tech sector growth is exceeding forecasts, Lane county has already added 500 of the 774 expected new jobs in the first three years of that ten year period.

The program has produced over 300 high-growth companies and over $1 billion in follow on funding. In contrast, the State of Oregon invests just a fraction of its annual budget in the state entrepreneurial eco-system (i.e.Oregon RAIN's budget is $2m for 2015-17 and split between Corvallis and Eugene). Any good entrepreneur knows that under capitalization can kill a startup. I encourage leaders to more fully examine Oregon's funding landscape to support the entrepreneurial eco-system"

Additionally, most of them work part time, mainly because keeping hours ""short"", usually less that 30 per week, allows employers to avoid paying any benefits.  So we're actually talking about, at the most, a 5% increase for 5% of the workforce.  This will hardly jeopardize Oregon's economy.  Also remember labor cost represent only a portion of a busiess's overhead.

That's a lot of automatically registered (in less than just two months!) voters who won't vote because it means nothing to them.  Which leaves the Oregon ruling party plenty of room for voter fraud.

""I don't know if we'll be contributing the city's contribution to that program or not.""  If the city does continue its funding support of First Stop, he says, he'd avoid any potential conflict of interest in the process by following the city charter guidelines, recusing himself from the vote.*  Both the present article and the linked WWeek article state that the City stopped funding First Stop when Hales took office, but I don't see any particular evidence for that statement. Rather, all I see is a promise by Hales to recuse himself from any decision regarding First Stop's funding, which doesn't seem to be invalidated by PDC's decision to continue supporting First Stop.

0,"In order to understand the level of culpability of the shooters, the RG reporter should have mentioned things like the distance between the shooters and the unfortunate lady and the type of rounds being fired.  High power rifle rounds can go for miles.  If the woman was hit at a distance of a mile, it is not surprising that the shooters did not hear her cries for help.  It is surprising to me that she was hit with multiple rounds since at distance that would require very high precision shooting.  If the shooting was at short range, more serious charges may have been warranted.  Whenever I target shoot, I make certain to place the target in front of a big hill and never shoot with the barrel elevated beyond the base of the hill.

Software jockey's tend to think highly of themselves, but those of use who have started high tech manufacturing companies and such see the focus to be a bit misplaced.

Because it is capital efficient to start software companies.  Small inputs of labor, consuming very little resource, can have a large impact.  Because they are cheap to start, we can get a lot of 'bang for the buck'.   Other companies is high tech manufacturing, food and beverage, and biotech have greater needs.  Many of the needs are infrastructure based.   We are also working on these components, but these take longer as the capital needs for these industries is greater.  This does not mean it won't happen, it just means it will take longer to align the resources to make it happen  The 'fanfare' is about education and getting the community to realize that in order for us to fuel our economy, we need to invest in things that will allow it to grow, and ensure the resources are here to support them."

0,"A quote from the pleadings does not prove anything.  Evidence from the criminal trial might have.  If they were close enough to hear her then they were guilty of far more serious offenses than they were convicted of.  Accident at a distance of a mile or more is more understandable than shooting toward inhabited space only a few hundred yards away which was likely visible to the shooters (given that the bullet was not stopped by intermediate objects).  If the reporter had given the distance, we would be able to conclude whether they heard her, as it is, we cannot.   We cannot read more into this article than is actually present.  After reading it, I do not know what happened beyond a woman was shot and a guy was convicted of having done it.  Why or how it happened and whether the shooters heard the woman cannot be reliably determined from the information given.  We can only hope RG reporters are more inclusive of information."
0,"Thank you science duck.  My point was that from the story itself we could not conclude much.  But if it was 100 yards, the transgression is very serious.  Facts help understand.  Too bad the reporter chose not to provide enough information to allow readers to appreciate what had happened.  From the comments here we see that readers make all sorts of conclusions without facts based on inferred but unsupported conclusions.  At 100 yards, the bullet's trajectory is mostly flat and if the bullet made it to the woman, the shooters likely were able to see her.  Shooting under such conditions is a serious offense akin to causing injury while driving drunk.  We do see, however, that the shooters claim not to have heard the woman, which contradicts implications in the pleadings that they did nothing despite knowing of the woman's injury."

What the story and presumably supporters of the bill do not tell us is whether a completed background check allowed by a 10 day window would have stopped the sale, i.e. would the shooter have been denied if the check was completed.  I can see zero reason for a background check to take more than 3 days (given the fully computerized records).  The ten day window will likely only be used to arbitrarily delay approvals to provide a de facto 10 day waiting period for fully legal gun purchasers.  That might be a good idea, but promoters of the bill should be honest about their objectives."

The officer drove his car into the rear end of the motorcycle when the motorcycle was at a full stop and the rider was just sitting on it.  The officer seriously kicked the rider for no apparent reason.  This is unacceptable behavior.  Moreover, the video demonstrates that Edwards undertook a high speed chase in which he placed himself and other motorists in danger.

There was a big forested area between them, about 100 yards wide.  There is no way that the shooters could have possibly seen her.  Fields was shooting handguns with his girlfriend at the time.  I would give good odds that it was probably his girlfriend, who most likely fired the errant shots, and not Fields himself.  Very few women are skilled or experienced at shooting handguns.  The handgun would have to have been very badly aimed way too high, in order for the bullets to make it over the trees, and then come down where the victim was hit.  To me, this sounds like it was a naive and new shooter struggling to control the gun, causing it to shoot over the target.  I wonder if the police did ballistic tests, to determine which handgun shot the victim?   One would think that they would have."

There is no way that they could have seen her through 100 yards of woods.  Go take a look at the terrain on Google Maps.  I would bet anything that it was probably Field's girlfriend, and not himself, that fired the errant rounds.   Shooting a handgun accurately is a very difficult skill to learn.   Very few women are proficient in shooting handguns.  I wonder if he may have even been trying to teach her how to shoot.  Still, the shooting took place on Field's property.   And I would bet that both handguns probably belonged to him too.   So he would clearly have primary responsibility for any accident taking place."

The tax is touted as a business tax with the implication that us ordinary people will not be affected by it.

Such stores, operating at 1.5 percent profit margin, would become unprofitable losing an amount equal to one percent of sales every year.  A company cannot long exist while losing money.  The company would be forced to raise prices to offset the tax with the effect of transferring the tax burden to us the citizens.  The poor will be especially hard hit by a 2.5 percent increase in food prices.  The proposed corporate sales tax will be borne by us the citizens and is regressive affecting the poor the most."

0,"Couple of things bother me about the shooting.  At 100 yards, it is very difficult to hit anything with a handgun.  I cannot help but wonder how the woman was hit twice.  Regarding trajectories, handguns do not have the range of rifles, but at only 100 yards the vertical drop of the bullet was likely not more than a foot or two.  This means that the bullet(s) had to traverse the forested region.  Since the handgun bullets could not penetrate anything substantial, we are led to believe that open spaces through the forest were present and that the shooters may have been able to see the woman.  Also at 100 yards, the shooters should have heard a loud cry for help.   But mostly all we can do is speculate because we are not privy to all the details.  I am confident that the DA got them for the maximum realistic charges because that's what DA's do."

Starting a non profit that funds interns and benefits a large group of students (Ainsworth, West Sylvan and Lincoln) is vital!  Why can't the community side do the the same?  What is stopping them?  They could fund teaching interns for their classrooms, just as Apoyemos has done. 2) A few years ago a SI family spearheaded a funding effort for a new playground at Ainsworth. Funds came in from both community and SI.  However, not enough funds were raised. Instead of abandoning the project all together the SI family, who no longer had kids at Ainsworth by the time the playground was complete, added their own money to complete the project to benefit all!"

0,"Excellent piece. People don't realize that it is ultimately the consumer who is pinched by these so-called business-only taxes; they are more or less pass-thru charges that hurt businesses (impairing their ability to compete with companies not exposed to the same taxes), workers (when costs of being in business go up, companies lay off workers), and consumers who pay higher prices for the same stuff as they did before.  Enough is enough. Perhaps the hostile tax environment may be part of the reason that the economy is so services oriented in Oregon. A lot of the Fortune 500 companies have left. The problem with such a services-oriented economy is that it is not very flexible. So, when economic downturns come around every 8 years, or so, the Oregon and other services-oriented economies (e.g. Arizona) is hit harder than the national average; a lot of the money used to pay for those services is sourced from discretionary income.  In recessions, people have less discretionary consumption."

The proposal under debate involves moving students to Ainsworth (from Chapman) by dismantling the Ainsworth Spanish immersion program & moving it to another location. Parents of Ainsworth Spanish Immersion kids are against changing the Spanish immersion program because it’s regarded as one of the best SI programs in the city. It’s in high demand.  It's a winning formula. The school gets great results.    Success stories in education are hard to find & we need more of them. We should be looking at how to create more 'Ainsworths' in other locations, instead of dismantling them & spreading the resources wafer thin.  There are other proposals that solve the over crowding issue with less disruption to west side families (in total), and they cost less. Portland Public School board: please do your homework."

Ainsworth SI is a 30 yr. old successful program that should be a model for a new immersion school or schools on the westside.  It is integrated in the school in a very successful way.

At those speeds he was clearly focusing on the road ahead and enjoying the adrenaline rush that high speed riding can give you. Between the full face helmet, the sound of a screaming engine, the wind noise at those speeds and the excitement of the ride, the rear view mirror is low on the list of things to pay attention to. But to be run into and knocked to the street after stopping is over reaction and loss of control. In the video it appears the rider is starting to kneel down (probably at the officers request) and then is kicked in the chest when the officer steps into view. The stunt the rider pulled should earn him hefty fines, loss of license and community service. There are places that high speed riding can be done legally but that does not include our streets and highways. Maybe court ordered anger management for the officer would be in order as well."

0,"Contrary to the article, the tax is not on top of the existing corporate income tax, but rather is a minimum tax that would be paid if it is greater than the tax on net income. The measure would probably result in an increase in taxes on the average company with more than $35 million in Oregon sales. Recent Department of Revenue data suggests there are fewer than 1,000 such companies in Oregon, and these companies account for a minority of sales in Oregon.   This measure would encourage smaller companies and companies with fewer transactions from production to retail sale, or at least smaller entities in between. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it counteracts a little bit of the advantage of big companies. The majority of the big companies that would pay the tax are out-of-state, so this measure would tend to keep more money within the state.  If food is too adversely affected, the legislature could change the tax for that industry."

""And I believe everybody should have the right to enjoy that love and that marriage.""*  *It was the last precept, though, that pushed Bailey from the church for about a year in 2011. ...*  *He returned after numerous conversations with elders led him to believe there was room for his beliefs in the church, he says.*  *""Families can have disagreements,"" he says.

More importantly, if we take at face value his assertion that he does not support regressive church doctrines, we must conclude that Jules has no leadership ability.

I also dispute your statement that the location of East Sylvan is less convenient to native speakers on the west side. Do some research and you'll find that East Sylvan is much better connected - both in terms of roads and also public transport.   I have seen people in the SI community that live in Forest Heights that are claiming that Ainsworth is more accessible than East Sylvan - don't they realize that anyone can look at Google maps and realize that their claims are ridiculous?"

When I look at his connections to a church I'd never attend, though, it makes me think he might also be pretty good at forming coalitions with the Other Portland, out on the east side where I grew up. Not bad! A mayor has to feel like family with the entire city, and that means making strong connections with a lot of VERY different people who would never choose to try to get along with each other.

0,"No, Sam Adams never attended. But i have seen gay couples worshipping there. And they're welcome to do so, of course.  The Bible doesn't teach that you should only worship with those that 100% agree with you. Neither do we. You don't even have to 100% agree with the leaders in order to serve in a leadership role at Imago, much less to attend. Even leaders need only be Christ-followers who will not *knowingly* lead others (by word or lifestyle) in opposition to what the elders decide. I doubt even the elders all fully agree on doctrine, but they are committed to unity and to Scripture above their own understanding. Again, even that is only for leaders and teachers, not for members.  After all, we're human, not God. Disagreeing is inevitable. We are by definition unable to fully comprehend Him, or even the rest of reality. Everyone's doctrine is flawed. The thing that unites us first and foremost is commitment to following Jesus as best we can and encouraging each other to do the same."

For both Ainsworth SI and Bridlemile, PPS's plan is to drastically reducing enrollment (by over a third each) and its not being transparent how it will provide services to programs that will lose several $100K ea.    The reason for under-enrolling Bridlemile is that a fully enrolled Bridlemile will overcrowd Reike--but its only the Bridlemile that would bear that burden in the new Wilson cluster.  Ainsworth SI is under-enrolled if it loses a co-located neighborhood school.  If SI leaves Ainsworth, it is under-enrolled.  The reason for under-enrolling SI, is to clear out space for families in the Chapman and Bridlemile catchments.  SI then goes to a closed middle school (ill-suited for elementary students) with no stated plan how to make the facilities work.  Only SI bears the burden in the new Lincoln cluster."

In other words, are non-white folks in jail for violent crimes more often than white folks? If so that would suggest a correlation between violent crimes and use of force -- people who commit violence are more likely to be targets of force in jail.

I would also suggest that the study control for exogenous variables (as suggested by Mike C.) such as the nature of the offence the suspect was charged with.  I also think that the reporting on this issue fails to recognize many of the caveats explicitly stated in the report.  The reporting focuses on uncertain conclusions as if they were gospel."
0,"These are valid points and I largely agree - just looking at rates of use of force without controlling for other relevant variables may suggest that a problem exists, but this report does not conclusively demonstrate that the is a problem.  I think the report was competently done as far as it went, but it simply didn't take the analysis to it's logical conclusion.  It looks like there was sufficient data to do tests for significance and control for exogenous variables, but nothing was done in this area.  Still, the response from the Sheriffs office is disappointing to me.  The letter from current research staff is vague and looks like an attempt to stonewall or disavow the report.  They make no attempt to enlighten anyone about the limitations of the study, but seem to attempt to discredit it."

0,"Nice article overall, though I think Brooks fails to emphasize the importance of raising children in a marriage as part of the moral aspect he mentions. While children are not a focus of some marriages, they are a focus of most marriages, especially during the 20 years or so it requires to raise a child. When a marriage fails or never even occurs and children are involved, it is a great moral failing of their parents with lifelong and even inter-generational consequences to them and their own offspring. More than any other factor it effects their income prospects and their likelyhood of having their own successful marriage. So while all the aspects Brooks mentions are crucial in choosing a good and lasting spouse, if children are expected to ever be a part of a family, that marital commitment must also be built around the children's needs and can be a great source of strength in maintaining marital commitment through difficult times.  Google ""importance of marriage to children."""

With President Obama's re-election, McConnell was very clear and open with his dedication to block any of the President's proposals.    State legislatures are just as partisan.

Jules is free to worship wherever he chooses.  That's not what this is about.  It is about the fact that the official doctrine of the church he chooses as his spiritual home is anti-woman and anti-gay (to frame it simplistically).  As voters, who are being asked to support an individual for a very important elected position, it is important that we have a complete picture of that individual.

I think government does have a healthy role to play in our society.     Seems there are many opinions on what that should look like!  Large bureaucracies with a very wide/diverse clients base will struggle using centralized controls.    That's certainly is true of many federal programs.   It's why some corporate mergers fail miserably and some succeed.    (although what may appear to be a failure, like bankruptcy, may be little more than a planned re-organization)  We can see fault in past federal policy Motley, but what we can't see is the chaos that Could be created by an unregulated market.

0,"Not everyone is ready for college directly after high school, maybe not ever.  We used to shudder at the idea of 'tracking' kids into a lower educational path; now all students are expected to go from high school to college, and many feel trapped.  Hands-on classes would give an option of classes in 'blue-collar' skills which allow them entry into a lucrative trade, making a good life for themselves and their families.  Many of those people will eventually attend college as adults to earn a degree, after they have grown a bit.    Regarding study of Algebra, it is surprising to hear any thinking adult disparage it as 'worthless'.  Anyone who solves problems in daily life or work uses algebraic principles.  Algebra is the dividing line between 'doing Math' and 'using Math tools for problem-solving'.   For young people, it requires a certain amount of mental maturity.  Some students are not there yet in high school, hence the need for more concrete-learning classes."

Unfortunately, that subculture has become the exception and not (I'd say far from) the rule.  With physical mobility, the extended family has been scattered across our vast nation.  Most Grandchildren see their Grandparents once or twice a year (after all they may live thousands of miles away) and, on the flip side, most Grandparents get to spend little time with their Grandchildren.  We no longer have a functioning multi-generational lifestyle.  Kids and parents, then, when they ""leave home"", it usually Kids (young men and women) spending their time with their ""age"" peers.  Young people don't have the opportunity to both ""give and receive"" from Grandparents.  Those who do are the fortunate exceptions.

If a candidate made this comment:    ""If Republicans focus on what government should be doing, which governments should be doing it, and how to do it effectively and efficiently, voters will listen and the Republican brand will become more appealing.""  I would consider them seriously.      It's a theme that I've tried to promote for about a decade now.   Any stable nation state has a strong government structure - no government is not an option.   But the US is a very large and diverse nation, and federal programs that don't acknowledge local input and control, will struggle.

The City has removed sitting areas from the center of ""downtown"" to try to eliminate loitering. The city provides parks and benches for resting a short distance to the east.

(I find it difficult to say, but in some cases institutional housing is the best way to offer advanced mental health care as well)     But after living in three very different parts of the country, housing needs are not same, not in price, not in needs, not in construction.

The Malheur occupation was a situation of rich ranchers exploiting the ignorance of poorer white people to legitimate the privatization of public lands, one of the aims of the super rich. The Malheur occupation didn't succeed. Poor white people have the disadvantage of being sucked into believing their interests lie with rich whites when it doesn't. At least the exploited masses of non-whites know who their enemy is. Poor whites are like the faithful dog whose owner regularly kicks them in the face, but keeps coming back for more abuse."

But if a president has an agenda at the center of which is the very serious problem of majority of the country's wealth being concentrated in the hands of a politically corrupt minority, the super rich, then at least the problem remains visible and the majority of exploited people can organize to politically attack these super rich extremists who view Americans not as people, but as raw materials to exploit and discard."

I appreciate that Jules' faith ""is a really big motivator for what I do.""  And I appreciate how he has stood up for the LGBT community in the Legislatore (per an email I just received from my Rep, Rob Nosse, who replaced Jules).

The RG proposes an action that highlights Republican obstructionism rather than gets a new justice on the court.  I personally believe Obama should take the high road and ask senate Republicans for a list of nominees that they could support.  If the Republicans are truly obstructionist, the list will be staunchly conservative.  It may be, however, that the list will contain compromise candidates acceptable to all.  Imagine a compromise!"

0,"Interesting that you reference KenPom.com, and don't discuss Pomeroy's recent study suggesting defenses have little control over whether their opponent's 3 point shot goes in.  What defenses can control is the number of 3 point attempts their opponents shoot.  In that regard, Oregon's opponents are putting up roughly a third of their FG attempts from three, and ~243 D1 schools are allowing more three point attempts (or 5 more P12 schools).   Programs like SMU, Syracuse, and Xavier are letting their opponents shoot 40% or more of their FG attempts from three (OSU is close to that group at almost 39%).  Certainly the Ducks can improve by reducing opponent 3 point attempts.  That should probably be the focus as opposed to whether or not a mediocre shooting team like Stanford happens to get hot on a Saturday in February.  Every team will have a hot shoot game eventually.  Even little Prairie View A&M, who shoots just 26.1% from deep, made 7 or 10 threes at Wisconsin in November."

Look up Adam Smith who promoted Capitalism where the producers and buyers come together, with buyers having all the information to make informed purchase decisions, and tell me how that happens today with multinational companies obscuring product information, engaging in monopolies and price fixing. Sanders promotion of Democratic Socialism is not about owning the Mom and Pop stores. It is about protecting the consumer from the onslaught of corporate power, where corporations are people, where they can buy Congress in hidden processes. If that is Capitalism, Adam Smith did not envision it as such.  We all pay no matter what. Right now we are all paying for products and services the profits of which are funneled into offshore accounts.

If they increase the lodging tax by .8% for 4 years, they will increase the revenues by 80% for 4 years.    That means in year 1, they will raise $14,700,000 (80% of $18,375,000).  In year 2, the new tax will raise $15,435,000 (80% of $19,293,750).  Then $16M in year 3 and $17M in year 4. In 4 years, the new tax raises $63,358,838.  More than enough for a track event ($25M).

In Eugene subsidized housing, like the HACSA run apartment building I live in, is supposed to be distributed around the city to avoid concentrations of poor people, but there is often neighborhood resistance by the middle class. Who don't want any apartments, especially for poor people.   Still, we have many such buildings, all well built, attractive and of a reasonable size.

When the historically marginalized, exploited and oppressed in the United States have power to make decisions about their lives and the US fulfills its obligation to be a truly democratic country who will need any more power? Why would people need to ""go"" somewhere ""after""? It is the super rich who are always hungry for more power, more control, more resources, more wealth. American history demonstrates that the privileged dominate the institutions of society for their own interests at the expense of everyone else. The masses would be content with control over their lives in the form of nationalized healthcare, access to education, an end to residential segregation, jobs that help people and the nation to adapt to climate change. There are enormous needs that are not being met because the government is dominated by the rich and  first and foremost serves their interests while disregarding the interests of the vast majority of citizens."

Knowing it is a part of a ""conservative Baptist"" (repetitive, I believe--are there ""liberal Baptist"" churches?) makes Jules membership/participation all the more troubling, given the formal positions--on women and the LGBT community--taken by the larger Baptist denomination.  CBA's own position paper, June 30, 2015, regarding the Supreme Court ruling that same sex marriage is Constitutional, calls on Baptists to ""mourn"" for those who. living in sin, can't know Christ.  This exclusionary religious perspective (which has given us countless bloody wars for centuries)--believe what we do or you can't be saved--requires, again, that I ask:  ""What the heck is Jules doing supporting this religious perspective?""

Unless a person believes that the Democrats managed to murder Judge Scalia, his death was not political.    The president should put forward any candidate he choses and it should be accepted or rejected by the Senate.         The law says that the senate must advise and consent.  I would take their unwillingness to do either as a clear message that their advice is of no value.    Conduct the hearing with the senators who are willing.   Silence speaks loudly, the President should acknowledge that message and then make the appointment.  Unconstitutional maybe, but we can examine that after the actions of the Congress are first considered."
0,This may seem cynical but this multi-candidate  format takes time away from the leading candidates who will actually shape public policy. Involving these other voices promotes democracy on a conceptual level but does a disservice to voters who will now spend less time with the candidates who actually impact their lives.
0,"There are not asked for the response THEY want to give.  The law is clear that the president makes a nomination and seeks the advise and consent of Congress.    it is abundently clear that delaying an appointment for stricktly polical partisianship is not part of the intent of the rules. The Senate has the right to ask all the question they want of a candidate.   If they have no questions I'd be pleased to see the nomination forwarded.  If the parties were reversed I would say exactly the same thing.  Apparently the Republican senate has forgoten how to lead and functions only as a reaction to the President.    I never imagined the rational Republican party would forget what it takes to lead, (the one big advantage I had given to pragmatic Republicans for most of the last 40 years)."

Some are rewarded for other activities, or simply by the reputation they earned many years ago. Sometimes, like in any organization, there is favoritism, nepotism, etc.  The status of tenure is also changing with this new generation of faculty, as universities and colleges no longer have (and most can't financially sustain) as many tenured faculty as they once did. This coincides with the fact that the structure of higher education is also changing as online education is becoming more prominent and campus-based higher education is less necessary for delivering quality research and instruction to a wide audience anywhere."

So effective this year, the limitation is now 12 years.  You also fail to mention that Oregon has a special provision if a DNA match is made.   If there is DNA evidence and there is a match, there is NO STATUE OF LIMITATIONS for ANY FIRST DEGREE sex crimes in Oregon.   And if it is a SECOND DEGREE sex crime, and there is a DNA match, the statue of limitations is 25 years.  And the notion that Oregon compares badly with other states is nonsense.   The statue of limitations for rape in California is 10 years.  The state of Washington is 10 years too.   So Oregon's 12 years is now LONGER than either of our neighboring states."

Obviously, every gun should be kept safe from unauthorized use. (So should cars and kitchen blenders.)

When police kill people, they usually say they did it because they had to decide in a split second so that even when the dead citizen has no weapon and posed no threat, the police are justified because split second decisions are often flawed.

0,"Bill: In 1969 I was teaching in an inner-city high school in Riverside, California.  The issue of affirmative action arose regarding ""advanced placement"" courses.  I presented the following idea which was adopted and worked.  1) We determined the percentage makeup of the student body (Black, Hispanic and non-Black/Hispanic.  We had almost a 1/3, 1/3 1/3 composition as it turned out. 2)  We determined the seats available in the classes....36 was the number used. 3)  The affected Departments chose their enrollment using those percentage figures. 4)  Minorities were ""equally"" represented based on their percentage of the school enrollment. 5) It worked out well, since there was no ""unfair"" affirmative action and no basis for claims of racial or ethnic discrimination.    As, I think,you and I agree, we need to address racial/ethnic/sexist discrimination while, at the same time, working to be fair, rather than punitive, in so doing.  best regards, Gary"

0,"USO is an ETF that attempts to track the cost of WTI oil.  It's mostly geared for people who want to short term trade the movements in oil.  You would be better served looking at the actually price of a barrel of oil (approx. $34.30).  The price of oil fell from ~$147/barrel to ~$30 in 2008.  The cost of gasoline subsequently fell into the $1.xx range.  Oil then rebounded to around $110/barrel, and has subsequently fallen back to the $30 range.  The cost of gasoline is once again back in the $1.xx range.    Oil is only one input cost for other goods and services.  Another factor to keep in mind is inflationary monetary policy.  M2 money supply has nearly doubled since 2008.  This is the biggest reason for the increase in the cost of living.  As you point out, the cost of everything is going ""up up and up.""

Knowing as many tenured faculty members as I do, it's not reasonable to think that a university president can ""make"" long-time tenured faculty (i.e., full professors) teach more classes. One, there's the issue of their contract and tenured status, which is effectively a life-time appointment, with a few exceptions (e.g., being arrested and convicted). Two, tenured faculty have long had a practice of ""buying out"" their teaching duties to pursue research. That's reality at large research universities. Three, tenured faculty have other obligations, such as department meetings, committee memberships, faculty senate, advising students, attending professional conferences,  etc.  What Schill really needs to do is to prioritize the cost cutting.

Trump is not only a mean-spirited, obnoxious person, he, additionally, hasn't clue one about the processes of governing or the issues involved.

0,"Bailey unambiguously voted to fund and build the Oregon only version of the CRC. Even ignoring the huge environmental problems with that project, the Oregon only proposal was extremely fiscally irresponsible. But Wheeler's hands are not very clean either in terms of fiscal responsibility. He easily could have issued a much stronger statement against the Oregon only proposal. Instead, his attempt to straddle the issues, meant that the CRC's proponents continued to spend money on the proposal ( tens of millions of dollars) for several more months. I think it is fair to at least partly blame Wheeler for those wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer money.  So take your pick--neither is good on the environment on this issue--they both want to build a new much larger bridge, and both seem willing to either waste lots of money pursuing that plan or to commit the state of Oregon to billions of dollars in debt to build it.

Our economy has devolved to the point where employers can have grownups for a teenager's wage.  It's nice for them, but not so good for the employees, or for society.  We could have a low teenage wage, or a low first 30-days on the job wage.

That may be so only because they know the government will step in and provide them with a basic living without them having to work at all. But from the standpoint of improving our economic situation as a country, increased productivity has been the path to greater wealth for all income levels for the past 240 years. Minimum wage laws very temporarily allow some entry level wage earners to earn more while simultaneously pricing others out of the market altogether.

(It's hard to keep track.) And his shocking disregard for norms of presidential speech and behavior (Waterboarding? Sure, and more!)

Having the nation's now-highest minimum wages will make this worse.  Something that is worth noting: Union pay scales are most often pegged to the minimum wage. The public sector unions that bought this legislation($100,000 from AFSCME to Gov. Brown and others) have just voted themselves another raise out of our pockets.

0,"Perhaps you think your employer is making a higher than normal profit due to paying you and your coworkers a lower wage than  you are worth to them. If that were so, why has another company not seen this as an opportunity and joined the competition for that higher than normal profit, which would automatically bid up the wages paid to you since there would be more demand for workers with your skills? More likely, you are unaware of the actual profitability (or lack of) enjoyed by your employer and are judging your pay not on your value to your employer, but on your own needs and desires. We all have needs, to be sure, but making someone else pay for them without producing equivalent value is not something that can ever work in the long run. This is what has happened in Greece.

0,"It takes the US Forest Service, discovering by accident, one of the many environmental toxic contaminant threats currently polluting this state of Oregon, solely because the state (and federal) public health and wildlife protection agencies cannot do their mandated responsibilities for detection, assessment, and public protection because legislatures are being irresponsible. The legislature sets the tone by funding, or withholding funding, of agency effort to effectively do their mandated work. For very many years, a culture has built up for the 'avoidance at any cost' of toxic contaminant monitoring unless some crisis in the media pushed a stop-gap blatant need. Agencies fear punitive legislative reductions of any agency that 'makes waves' by pointedly investigative work that could demonstrate ongoing toxic pollution for humans and wildlife. Legislatures erroneously see such investigatory monitoring as being inherently politically and fiscally subversive, but such work is essential."
0,"The Portland toxic metal air pollution is only the tip of iceberg of intentionally neglected toxic pollution due to agencies fear of censure by lawmakers.

Monitoring (with integrity) is essential to science, and science needs to inform our progress into a more sane future for all residents and visitors to our state."

Let's avoid the Rice and Powell defense as another issue. The simple question is: Did Bowers make an accurate statement that Clinton is a criminal?  Many people believe she has committed a crime. The web is replete with such accusations. The sheer quantity and quality of  of accusations would lead some to believe she is guilty, and thus a criminal.  This overwhelms the criteria that one is innocent until proven guilty which is basic to our legal system.  Now Bowers may have an opinion that Clinton is a criminal but to him it is a fact. He has convicted Clinton, as have others. Now that opinions are facts and criminals are convicted by accusations,  discourse turns to who can yell lies the loudest. People might not trust the legal system, but it's what keeps us civil."

0,"I see.  I have always found percentage confusing when used in such constructions.   From your comment, I suspect that you interpret 126% higher to mean that the tech wage is 226 percent of the average wage.  So Y is X % higher than Z means Y= ((X+100)/100)*Z.  Is this what you mean?  So 45K * 2.26 = 102K, which is close to what the reporter gave as the average tech salary.  All this is well and good.  But my essential point was that I do not believe the given average tech salary for a minute.  Having worked in tech all my life, the manufacturing operators and such who comprise so many of the tech workers tend to earn about 15-20/hour, far less than 105K/year.  It may be that the average tech salary is inflated by the incomes of the extremely rich company owners.

One might assume that as school enrollment, course offerings, and test scores decrease, appropriate funding would be provided to resolve such issues; however, this is not reality. As schools suffer, funding dwindles, leading to further issues.   Most low-income families from the NEHS area do not have the time, money, or resources to transfer their children to other schools, thus are limited in their options. Families with such resources however do, and they choose their schools accordingly. This ongoing cycle of economically secure families transferring their children away from NEHS leaves only families suffering from socio-economic disparity. We see the same cycle all over the US.

If that means they hire fewer from Duck U than Stanford, that means Stanford is producing a better computer person--maybe because you are there teaching Computer Science.   Would you prohibit a person from taking Computer Science at Stanford instead of at Duck U because that will mean Duck U gets less money?  That appears to be your rationale for denying North students the ability to transfer to what they perceive to be a better school for them.  If that results in a disparity based on income, so does Microsoft's selection processes for hiring computer people."
0,"Our community and more specifically the district board needs to address the anti-North sentiment that prevails in our city. I believe the first step to this is removing the ""school choice"" option.   I am an AVID Tutor for the school district and have been for three years. Over these years, I have worked consistently at 6 schools across the district. I love my job and my students. However, I don't love going on defense every time I mention my alma-mater of North Eugene. Students usually respond with ""Ew."" or ""Gross."" or ""North's ghetto."", while staff members will ask me in a concerned, worried manor ""...and how was it?""  Why is this? Why is the only IB-world school in Eugene with two student-ran businesses ""ghetto"" or worrysome? This is a funding issue, a class issue, and a race issue. And it's circular."

0.166666667,"When you cut funding for a school, programs are cut, and teachers wither. Education is at stake. So, people go to schools that offer what they want. As Mr. Cranor said below, these are usually students with better-off parents, leaving the poor kids behind. Meanwhile, Marist (just across the river) offers North-region students sports/academic scholarships, increasing transfer #'s. The district notices a decline in enrollment and cuts more. The same process continues. It doesn't end. And it won't. Unless 4J halts the ability for some schools (South Eugene) to flourish while others (North Eugene) scramble to handle cuts in staff and budget.   Clair Wiles put it perfectly. School choice is segregation, absolutely. Ms. Dragt is absolutely justified in her concerns for a shutdown, because it won't change without action.   I urge the school board to eliminate school choice and to focus on providing a truly equitable experience for students at all 4 high schools."

0,"Oregon funding works as you say, but the Eugene Education Fund (EEF) does not.  It goes where the people who donate it want it to go.  The more affluent the families there are in any given school, the more funding they have to spend on programs and additional FTE (teachers).  This leads to an embarrassment of riches at some schools with other schools getting by on the 10% hold back in grants that all schools can apply for.   Individual parents can do for the schools their children attend what we as a community are not allowed to do for our schools as a whole, namely pass funding levies to pay for additional programs and teachers.  Affluent schools get 90%, everyone else splits the 10%.  Does this sound like equity?"

I don't see much strategic focus here, specific to student success outcomes. Quite simply, when students = revenue (which they do) and the students pay for an education with the goal of sustained employment upon graduation and that doesn't happen, students cease to enroll. Then revenues decrease. Reactively and strategically focusing on subsets of the real problem is what traditional education does best Tenure does not equal student success outcomes"

I discount favorable reviews when they the same wording as the marketing of the business, because I suspect those are owners, friends, family of owners, not objective customers.

So the question is: How far can online comments go? Though many people think words have distinct boundaries (falsely calling them ""definitions""), they can be more fuzzy around the edges.

Note that they were charged with a number of gun crimes, so they were a clear threat to go nuts with their guns again.  It would have been disastrous for the FBI to have moved in sooner against a bunch of crazed people hold up at a ranch with guns.

0,"One of greatest successes at the University of Oregon was the development of the zebrafish model organism. It is now considered one of the best systems for studying many aspects of development and disease, and Oregon gets a large amount of cachet for being the source of it. Interestingly, George Streisinger took many years to make the system work, and was considered by any outside metrics to be unproductive during that time. He would have been first on the chopping block if his employment was in the hands of a bean-counting Dean and he did not have tenure to protect him.  Now, how to discern the unproductive from the temporarily unproductive future game-changers and protect only the latter? That I don't know. Maybe protecting game-changers is too much to ask of a university in dire financial straits and too much to ask of students in debt.

0,"""In fact, cellulose fiber in the diet is beneficial.""  Seemed counterintuitive to me.  But according to a recent San Francisco Food Column he's right.   Cellulose passes through your digestive system, aiding in the removal of waste from your body. This waste can include normal metabolic waste excreted in the bile, but may also include sugar and cholesterol if your blood levels are elevated. If you do not eat high-fiber food, your body continually reabsorbs excess sugar and cholesterol. Soluble fiber binds excess sugar and cholesterol in your intestines carrying them out of your body via solid waste. A high-fiber diet can improve heart and colon health and aid in weight loss. Cellulose is not digestible and serves no other purpose in your body aside from aiding in waste removal.   Cellulose is classified as ""generally regarded as safe,"" or GRAS, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This means there is no scientific evidence that suggests cellulose may have any adverse effect."

0,It is important for citizens understand that business will not pay any of the proposed massive tax increase.  All the tax increase will be passed on to the citizens in the form of price increases.  Business exists to make money and certain margins are necessary to make it worth while to stay in business.  So to maintain necessary margins each affected company will increase prices of goods or services rendered.  Same as will happen to fund the new minimum wage legislation.    It is really important to understand that both the minimum wage cost and the massive business tax cost will be paid by we the people of the state of Oregon.

0.166666667,"As a graduate of the University of Oregon, BA '69 and JD '71, my personal experience as an undergraduate in the liberal arts was that 'freedom of speech', with some few fortunate exceptions, was freedom to regurgitate each particular professor's course notes in the style which he preferred.   Most were arrogant, extremely pleased with themselves and viewed undergraduates as unfortunate necessities.

You are correct, we are pretty genteel. But not compared to our past two decades. Yet very much so compared to how the Framers spoke (in the paper today). Shall we judge our standards via world norms or our own criteria?  Not that anyone really cares, but I believe many people in the world look to us and see a civil political process. What they see recently is surprising. But it is not without precedent. The R-G even had to invoke this Civil Comments process to get a handle on what is happening."

0,"This is a complex issue with bits of truth on many sides.  In light of Edwin Coleman's findings, the assertion that black students feel ""unsafe"" in the building, if true, suggests a serious educational flaw exacerbated by today's negative emphasis on wrongs rather than rights (as if victimized groups don't have enough ""real"" issues to worry about).  Ironically, universities (with a few glaring exceptions - see Donald Trump's perversion) are supposedly established to discover and broadcast truth.  From that perspective, it would seem that keeping Deady's name on the hall could provide a valuable spring board for demonstrating how racism can be transformed into tolerance and positive social action - which is just what Deady appears to have done in his lifetime.  If delivered, that lesson could go far toward alleviating black student's concerns about entering the place and help to constructively recast campus dialogues for improving inter-group relations."

The examples could go one for pages.  Sign codes do, in fact, often limit freedom of expression; and complaint driven enforcement is, by definition, selective.

The taxpayers of Oregon and their elected representatives have always been cheap about higher education, have resented every penny, and have cut accordingly, to the point where all that's left is the resentment. But the UO (along with OSU, PSU, WOU, EOU, SOU, and OIT) bear a mandate to educate the young of Oregon inexpensively. The UO achieves this -- and yes, tuition is relatively low -- by recruiting out-of-state students. Somebody has pay for the institutions that Oregonians demand, despite their unwillingness to fund them. Thank heavens for the moms and dads of California, Washington, and the Pacific Rim. They pay your tuition."

0,"Yes that is about how much funding the University receives from the state. And yes the motto in academia is ""publish or perish"". All of the professors, including the adjuncts and associates, continuously have to be active in research and publishing if they ever hope to get tenure, or to get hired at a prestigious university that pays well. The problem, and I am speaking from the point of view of humanities in general, is that they don't specify the type of research that is favored from the top down. They are purposefully vague about it. In reality, they are letting go of people who, in languages especially, are specifically trained to teach languages. They expect TTF (tenure track facutly) to do these people's jobs thinking that they, as the content creators of the future (according to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences) should be the ones teaching the future generations of researchers. That may be fine and well in the sciences, but in languages it is not going to beneficial."

Indeed, until the 1970s the Mormon church was openly racist, as well as misogynist.

John McCain was a good candidate, who was very qualified to be our President.  He deserved the nomination in 2000, but by 2008 he wanted the presidency so badly that he went over to the dark side, and started pandering to the fringe on the right.  It's a dangerous thing, trying to harness hatred.  He chose an utterly scary and unqualified running mate because of her gender, and pretty much created the Tea Party, which in turn spun out of Republican control.  Now the Republicans find themselves without much of an identity, except as the party of hate and negativity.  Their history is better than that.  I think they can come back from this, but it will be hard work, and they will probably lose this next election unless they can escape Trump.

No. There is no option other then to sue the State for knowingly accepting a unsustainable contract BUT the State is PERS both the Judiciary and Legislature  are a part of PERS.

0,"Yes, PERS similar to military as re: frontline at risk roles. There is a lot the general public may not know about PERS and the process of job description review. Does the state use a tiered system of ""risk"" in public safety roles as regards salary and retirement. Do all in Fire and Police who work behind the frontline in support positions receive the same option for retirement after same number of years of employment. More importantly,  is the State practicing ""lean thinking"" and eliminating unnecessary payouts thru attrition or seeing that jobs are paid at the same/similar level as the private sector. The PERS management has been experienced as a failure by most taxpayers who many feel are on the hook to pay for a bad contract."
0,"Virtually all your questions regarding the Fire and Police are answered with ""No"".  The desk officer and the front line officer have the same time frames for retirement.  The attrition question is also ""No"".  Their pay is determined by the collective bargaining  agreement negotiated between each governmental body and their public sector unions, which is how PERS got where it is now.  EPD will negotiate with the City of Eugene on rates and increases of salary, for example.  Springfield does the same, Portland does the same.   One size does not fit all.  The risk of patrolling Northeast Portland does not equate to the risk of patrolling Eugene.  The fire fighting skills needed in Portland also differ from those in other communities in the state.  The cost of living varies throughout Oregon as well.  The ""State"" is not in charge of any of those decisions.  The State sets standards for varying levels of policing; each community goes from there  on salaries and benefits."

We should not look weak to other countries. Not just militarily, but also in image. When Obama bows to a leader, he is embarrassing our country.  3.

It has been identified as one of the fastest growing segments of our local economy, with a median wage that is significantly higher than the local median wage.    It is capital efficient.  The infrastructure needs for software are modest compared to other industries.    It is traded sector.  Money from the production of software that is sold around the world brings money from outside this region into the region, growing the tax base that can be used to support, and expand, community services.    It is resilient. Having many small to medium size companies insulates us from adverse effects to the economy that may affect any one sector.

Frankly, if I were part of the GOP leadership I would factor in the possibility that the next President could be Clinton or Sanders, and if a Republican, could be Trump, and think about voting for someone in the center if nominated.

ALL developed nations have, with the lone exception of the US--- though Obamacare has taken us closer, much closer.  You have challenges in finding workers---- but you did find them, didn't you? Perhaps something is wrong with your wage structure: pay more.  Your competitors also face the same challenges: the impact won't be on your business, alone. Higher wages mean more money for workers to spend-- at your business. In a nation where the largest employer is a warehousing chain (Walmart) and the other huge similar businesses employ massive numbers of workers, I'm sorry to tell you that a living wage is a necessity.  You say you're not wealthy--- but that's a comparative term. How much does your paycheck work out to, per hour?  On a personal note, you should take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself how much the well-being of your neighbors means to you--- or if they're just so many robots."

Because they did not care about justice?  No.  Statutes of limitation were enacted for the sake of justice in recognition of the fact that as time passes facts become less clear, memories fade, and justice, real justice becomes impossible.  Rape in particular is an emotional crime.  To a very real extent, those charged must prove their innocence rather than be proved guilty.

Our disagreements stem from a profound difference of values and consequently, what we think a collection of citizens is all about; indeed, what life is all about. If it is just to see who can accumulate the most money, or for each person to maximize their self worth in money--- it's a pretty empty place, morally, emotionally, and philosophically. Men (or women) that do all they can to pay little taxes and then make a PUBLIC spectacle of ""doing good"" are contemptuous. In the end, it's all about them, their largesse. I believe somewhere in the bible it admonishes givers not to let the left hand know what the right is doing. That's quite a contrast from having it splashed all across the country in every available media.  But we disagree, profoundly, MC. Recent studies show we indeed may trace our differences to genetic predispositions."
0.1,"Motley, if a DA believes a rape has been committed, I believe that DA will be absolutely certain that the rape kit is processed.  I believe the untested rape kits come from situations where the identities are not really in question and the facts surrounding the incident do not support a rape charge.  As you know sexual intercourse is not illegal.  A rape kit tells whether sexual intercourse has occurred and via DNA the male involved.  But if a DA determines that circumstances do not support rape but rather consensual sex, the rape kit provides no useful information.  Of course, every rape kit where the male is unknown should be processed.  I doubt that the unprocessed kits fall into that category.  Too bad some investigative reporting has not occurred."

0,"Just my opinion, but I also think that raising the wage works against developing a work ethic in the young because very few employers want to pay those wages to teens who are generally eager for a 'first job'. They want older employees that they feel will be more reliable or who won't have school schedules to work around. I know that all of my kids were excited to work and earn their own money when they turned 16, only to find out that at not all, but most places, they couldn't ""flip burgers"" until they were 18. They were discouraged from working because they were not old enough. SO it falls to mom and dad to cover their costs, and not give them the opportunity to learn about being responsible with work and finances before they fly the coop. I see this as a great disadvantage."
0,"Most of this is irrelevant to the minimum wage issue. He pays above minimum wage so it won't affect his business. Nor will it affect most businesses since a small percentage of workers make minimum wage. The fact is, people need to make around $15 per hour in Oregon just to survive, and that's if they get 40 hours a week, which many do not.  From an employee's point of view, the only one that matters to people who don't own a business, a job that pays less than what we need to survive is worthless.  ""In a very basic sense, how can an employer not raise prices to compensate? "" Um, if customers are not willing to pay higher prices? But most will, and some of the businesses that pay low wages, like restaurants, are selling middle-class luxuries that a lot of us can do without.  I don't know why he's having trouble finding good employees. Maybe because Oregonians aren't willing to pay for a decent educational system? In any case, it's a separate issue from the minimum wage."

0,"This comment is utter nonsense. The business pays a wage above the minimum already and has a hard time attracting quality applicants. If the minimum goes up, the employer will have to offer an even higher wage to attract the same low quality of applicants. Markets determine the relative value of wages in relation to every other good and service offered for sale. To pretend otherwise is to don a tinfoil hat and pretend that the laws of supply and demand do not exist. I suspect that you, sir, subscribe to some rather crackpot economic theories, such as Marx's labor theory of value. You seem to understand very little of how the world actually works."
0,"Finally, some sane commentary on the wage floor. It would be great if we could just mandate that everyone gets a ""fair"" wage, but the real world is far more complicated than some would like to believe. To assign a ""fair"" wage, one has to assume that all other inputs are equal. Some jobs produce more, some skills are in more or less demand. Markets, supply and demand, determine the relative value of wages and what employers must offer in order to attract the employees they need.   This new law will have unintended consequences, as all other feelgood interventions do. I feel badly for the small to medium-sized business owners who will be forced to either adapt to this new regulation or perish. The disemployment effect will be felt very harshly during the next economic downturn, you can bet your copy of ""Das Kapital"" on that."

It doesn't.  Canada and Great Britain don't have our screwy tort system.

0,"The notion that ""laws are rarely enforced"" is not grounded in any empirical evidence. It might be grounded in personal, unscientific evidence, but that is anecdotal. I might as well claim that a ticket I got for failing to come to a complete stop while driving proves the police are aggressively ticketing.  We have no standard of what is ""rarely"" enforced nor do we have a list of tickets issued by local authorities. I would imagine they are in the thousands per year in Lane County. The second notion is that for laws to work, they must be enforced. I guess the people making that statement aren't following the laws, because if they were, they'd know that regular 'ol folk follow laws just because it is the right thing to do. What people really believe is that there should be more enforcement but only for those laws they follow that others break.

Or is it masses of older folks deciding to retire, early: cashing out to take advantage of the stock market?

I see people texting (the rapid switch of focus from the crotch to what's going on in front of them and back again), people making other than hands-free calls on their cell phones, people busting through intersections on lights already turned red, and all manner of other dangerous infractions.

As I've often pointed out, Eugene is unique in being the city to actually lose cyclists in recent years. According to the US Census American Community Survey, we lost 37% of our cycling commuters back into cars between 2009 and 2014. Everyone else gained cyclists.

There are a couple of prevailing attitudes within the policing community and community at large that lead to officer involved shootings. One is the attitude of fear: Kill or be killed is the idea.

Lyft is just another Uber. They don't pay us more or less. The only thing they have different from Uber is the option to tip in app.  Don't believe the hype. There's nothing I have a harder time understanding about those who drive for both than talking Uber down because Lyft pays you a $10 or $20 referral fee when you get people to use Lyft for the first time. Just tell people what it is and ask them to try it out, tell them they get a free ride and you make $10 bucks.  It's a win-win without trash talking the other company who pays you.  6.

If I’m in a medical facility and a guy attending to me has a name scrawled across his neck, I’m going to question his judgment and the judgment of whoever hired him.

No mention whatsoever by those folks of shooting back or hurting any of the law enforcement personnel.  The police actions were murderous and barbaric.  Listen to the poor kid in the car crying and the other adults talking.  Nothing about resisting but the bullets just kept coming.
0,"Let's please stop calling Imago Dei a non-denominational church. It is part of the Conservative Baptist denomination, and has been for many years. In the bigger picture, Christianity is a big tent religion, the evangelical version not so much, conservative baptists even less so.  Alternatively, why does someone who attends church XYZ have to agree with all of what the church leaders believe? Most of what commentators on this thread are bashing Imago Dei for are not specifics spelled out in the churches set of published beliefs, so parishioners are free to think how they want, hence why Jules feels at home there."

There are jobs out there that pay high simply because they are undesirable (or unsafe in some cases).

(Interestingly, gays didn't seem too concerned about not being able to marry until fairly recently, but that's not my point) But to compare the fight for gay marriage to King's fight for racial justice is ludicrous.

The police justify their killing (as always) by the need for self protection.  Could they have deployed differently so that self protection was not a core issue?  Imagine if the officers had deployed behind secure cover which in this pre-planned action was entirely possible.  Then they would not have been at extreme risk and the need to fire on speculation would have been removed.  By simple changes in deployment tactics, police could have allowed the perps to choose to use deadly force (justifying a lethal take down) or surrender.

Lower paid non-tenured faculty are an important part of an efficiently run modern University.  It is important to have a portion of the faculty that takes teaching as a first priority rather than research.  The teaching portion of the faculty is cost effective in supporting the primary educational function of the University.  Research is a secondary function of the University and it is very expensive.  Tenure-track faculty are typically heavily involved in research which requires substantial time.  Such faculty may teach only one course per term (or none).  The trustees, as representatives? of the citizens of Oregon, must decide whether to go with cost effective contract employees or expensive tenure-track faculty.  Truth be told, research provides limited benefit to Oregonians but is very expensive.  (A former tenured professor.)"

Imagine if, instead of the tens of thousands per state for abortions - the tens of millions of patients per state could show up with little to no previous medical history, screening, education, pre or post service assistance programs - no emergency care relationships, no emergency care facilities..  You really want less safety for patients?"

0,I think he makes some valid points. I'm also not a republican but  minimum wage doesn't benefit anyone. If the government cared about helping people making minimum wage than they'd subsidize FICA so the minimum wage worker could take home more each pay period and wouldn't expect the small business owner to just foot the bill.  When minimum wage increases all costs go up. The person making over minimum suffers because their pay won't increase at the same rate . All companies will raise their prices and everything from housing to food cost will go up to compensate. All you have to do is look at cost of living vs wages in Oregon from the last 30 years. It's a terrible law for everyone but the lawmakers who basically just raised taxes for the business owner.
0,"I'm not sure you understand how abortion works. There are mainly two ways women get abortions early in pregnancy: one is to take two pills. That doesn't require emergency facilities. One is a very short procedure to remove the growing cells inside the uterus. That also does not result in anything that requires emergency facilities. Those numbers are percentages, not based on total numbers. No woman who goes to a clinic gets either type of abortion with no screening. The women who do get abortions without medical screening are women who get illegal abortions, which is what women do in places abortion isn't available. These laws have nothing to do with safety. They have everything to do with controlling women's bodies and taking away their freedom. And putting women in the life-threatening situation of getting an illegal abortion."

0,"Minimum wage increases are far more insidious than than what has been posted here. For example, if Company A's costs are $1.00 to put a product on the market and they want 10% profit, cost of the item is $1.10. If the cost increases due to minimum wage to $1.10, the 10% profit now makes the item $1.21. That increase is, of course, passed on to the consumer. Now look what happens. The business' gross increases, which means they have to pay higher taxes at the end of the year. The minimum wage worker also has to pay higher taxes, and that increase outpaces the gains made by the minimum wage worker. The result? More tax money to the state and the worker falls even further behind. But wait, there's more. Many union wages are ties to minimum wage, meaning that their pay is based on a percentage added to minimum wage, i.e., their wages go up, forcing those companies to raise their prices.

This to me is a disservice to the students who are paying an ever increasing amount of money for an education that is taught by PhD students or Faculty who don't do research. The fact that the UO gives out more degrees than other universities per tenured faculty members should not be applauded, that is why Schill was brought in, to reverse course on that very subject.

Fifth, if you can't afford to pay basic wages then you should not be in business.  You are purely making money by taking advantage of how terrible low income workers wages already are.

It is the responsibility of the employee to garner the necessary skills to demand more money due to their skill set. Minimum wage was conceived as an entry level wage, designed to teach young people the difference between french fries and boogers, how to act professional in the workplace and to teach them rudimentary skills upon which to grow and become more valuable in the workplace. And while it is obvious many minimum wage workers are not high school students, it's not the employers responsibility or obligation to help solve poor choices made by others. They certainly CAN, but it's not their obligation. McDonald's didn't impregnate your girlfriend and has no responsibility towards that.

0,"Aggregate demand increases with an increase in wage.  Since inflation on an aggregate level is around .04% with an increase in minimum wage, the benefit of the increased wages go directly into consumption because most low income earners have a high marginal propensity to consume.  That means they spend nearly all the income they earn and it flows back into the economy.  That compares to a working with low MPC (a doctor for example) that with an increase in income, the amount that flow back into the economy directly is only proportionate to what they are willing to spend and not the amount they are saving or investing.   In other words, if you increase wages at the bottom it flows back to the top offsetting the additional costs in the long run.  The problem is that it does take time for the changes to reach the long run outcome which is why there are incremental increases rather than one huge jump."

I had the fortune of meeting so many good people in Portland who encouraged me to see where not riding trains would take me. Regardless of the short term emergency answers that American cities come up with, mental health resources cannot be overlooked because homelessness and the circumstances which lead to homelessness are traumatizing.  For me, the work it took to navigate the changes of an improved socioeconomic status were in many ways more challenging than adapting to the dangers and plights of poverty.

0,"Seeing the first aerial video release a few weeks back, I was concerned about whether or not the police had conducted this operation properly due to how close to the curve they had set up their roadblock, how the police had stationed themselves in dangerous positions at that roadblock, and whether they truly needed to shoot Finicum. The footage was fuzzy with no audio, and I am a big believer that people should comply with police commands in order to avoid a bad outcome, something Finicum clearly did not do, so I reserved judgement for the most part. This new footage with audio, the rationales discussed in the press conference, and the cover up of shots by the FBI all give me greater concern, not less.  It is clearly possible the police may have designed this situation to provoke an opportunity to shoot at least one of the high profile protesters to dissuade others from staging similar protests in the future. I would like to hear those involved swear under oath this was not the case."

It affects the employer because it is harder to find skilled employees unless he increases his wages too. In order to do that he will need to increase his prices or take home less money himself... which is I think the goal of your ""logic"" here.

The only organization that is seriously addressing the issue is denigrated as the evil ""gun lobby"" rather than being supported by our local and national leaders. I think we can also note that many more children than those injured or killed by careless gun ownership are similarly injured or killed by careless drivers, careless caretakers who leave household chemicals unattended, careless supervision of children outside of the home.  I think you get picture, and it is overall an important issue to address.  Thanks again."

1,"""A life sentence for the offenses against Malheur is too harsh.""  Alan:  I've seen nothing in any other news reports about these charges that would indicate that a life sentence is possible.  I believe that this Associates Press news report is thus in error on this point. In fact, other news reports that I have read have indicated that this other charge ( using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence ) has a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence ( much like the Arson charge the Hammonds were convicted of ), and a 10 year maximum. The Justice Department has determined that the seizure of the refuge was legally a violent act, despite the fact that no one was hurt.  I would expect a 5 year sentence on this charge, just like the Hammonds got. That is probably all that they will get.  And no less, due to the mandatory 5 yr sentence requirement.  So don't worry about a life sentence.  That comment was probably just more sensationalism by the press. Or a dumb reporter."

No one in their right mind was in favor of doing away with this refuge, and opening it up for cattle grazing and hunting, as Bundy and Finicum told the public that they were doing.   They actually tore down a fence to help ranchers bring their cattle on the refuge, only to have the next door rancher have to repair the fence at his own expense, in order to prevent his cattle from straying onto the refuge.   The rancher wanted nothing at all to do with their insanity.  And Finicum even publicly invited hunters to come hunt on the refuge.  No, these men were clearly unhinged and cuckoo."

Peaceful protesters do not heavily arm themselves with firearms.  Besides the pistol found on Finicum, there were two fully loaded AR-15 Assault Rifles in his vehicle, one of which belonged to him.  There was also a revolver inside the vehicle as well.  And did you not hear in the new recording of how they were looking to grab their guns at the start of the incident, so that they could shoot members of law enforcement?  Are the lives of Oregon State Police officers not also important to you?  If you and Outsider77 really are in favor of calming tensions, then you should be calling on these extremists to get rid of their guns, and stop confronting the Federal government with them.

There really are no laws that have been created to cover these kinds of acts, so the government has to use what is available under the law to prosecute.

I don't think this has much to do with ""white privilege"", unless you want to go further and say the entire founding of the US was white privilege.(all land was acquired through violence at some point in the past) It has more to do with a lack of knowledge of how to change the system, and a growing frustration of many folks in the rural west, much of it justified.

Armed robbers especially should be given relatively short sentences so that there remains a very substantial margin between shooting and not shooting someone.  If the potential shooter knows that pulling the trigger costs a great deal (in terms of sentence), we win through lives saved. Drugs should be legalized.  The damage to society of locking up so many involved in drugs and engendering disrespect for the law is likely worst than that which would be associated with legalizing drugs .  While it may feel good to lock folks up for long terms, we pay for the good feeling.  Giving long sentences for simple property crimes, sex abusers, etc. removes the great divide between killing, the ultimate crime, and recoverable events.

NOBODY in Congress is proposing any of those, so there really is no “far left” representation in Congress. Re the marriage equality issue.  What is RIGHT with it is that it guarantees the same “marriage” rights to everyone—Social Security, inheritance, parenthood, e.g.  Finally NO ONE (certainly not me) is saying that anyone should be forced to define marriage.  If Mormons or Imago Dei or whomever wants to define it a certain way, go for it.

0,"When I was in the military, many of those selected for jobs requiring Top Secret Security Clearances turned out to be Mormons.  They had several advantages over other soldiers.  They didn't use alcohol or illegal drugs; they didn't patronize prostitutes; many were in fact married by the time they served and their educational backgrounds often exceeded those of non-Mormons.   With a lack of criminal histories and the fact that all those things they didn't do have often resulted in the compromise of Classified information by those who were inclined to those vices, it was a no brainer.  I've heard anecdotal reports that non-military Federal Government organizations with security clearance requirements also have LDS types for the same reasons (CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.)   Check out the movie, ""The Falcon and the Snowman""."

The fact that they may be from somewhere else is irrelevant. Local poor people travel too. I know some who have gone to Portland. There is always the hope that if you can't survive here you may be able to somewhere else. Hope blooms eternal.

Students could transition between tracks at any time, with certain restrictions.  Those who graduated on a vocational track could still go on to college by picking up needed prerequisites at the nearby free two-year college, and many did so.  Then some parents began worrying about 'tracking', and the curriculum started changing; more students graduated without a clear plan.   Not every child is ready for college at 18, if ever.

The overall 2015 high school graduation rate for the entire Eugene School District was only 74%   So other Eugene high schools did far worse.   South Eugene is an affluent area.  The parents are rich, and tend to be more intelligent and educated themselves.   They tend to have more intact families where the kids have both a mother and a father living with them.  These parents are probably stressing the importance of an education to their kids too.   And they are probably getting their kids into more wholesome activities than playing video games or skateboarding.  The Springfield School District is an even less affluent area.   And its overall graduation rate was only 66%.   So a third of the students failed to graduate.

If this is typical everything probably blew up all a once, and the people who were involved in the different areas of the station were let go, or quit.  Of course it is going to be disorganized.  If the station has the size of music library that it is rumored to own, doing an inventory could take a LONG time.  Particularly if parts of that library are hard to come by, rare copies or transcriptions extra care would be taken to catalog each c.d., record, tape, or acetate.  An equipment inventory likely wouldn't take long.  Sadly, I believe people are not really appreciating the addition of Peter van de Graaff.  I've listened to his late night/early morning syndicated show for years and it is truly a gem.  To have Peter become a part of our local arts community is a coup for Eugene and KWAX.  I welcome Peter and his passion for the musical arts.  Whoever hired Mr. van de Graaff, well done!"

On the other hand, 5% of jobs are minimum wage, and many of those are restaurant/retail, so the number of minimum wage jobs that touch a supply chain can be high (agriculture) to low (specialized tool construction)."

That's 14 percent.  http://www.lanecounty.org/Departments/HHS/HSC/Documents/PIT_COUNT_Highlights_2015.pdf  So I can't really see addiction as a ""leading"" cause of homelessness.

I wonder what percentage of the housed have ""chronic alcohol/substance abuse issues""?"

If they wanted to capture Finicum alive,  why did an ELITE FBI team's sniper fire two shots - a ""double tap"" - at Finicum immediately as he stepped out of the truck with his arms held high? And then lie about the shots, with 4 other members of the ELITE FBI team also lying to support the shooter?   The bullet was an inch or so low and instead of killing Finicum, which it was directly on target to do,  went thru the roof and blew out the left rear passenger window.

Yet, both of these bills had the infamous ""emergency"" clause in them, which basically blocks the right of the people under Oregon's Constitution to ask for a referendum before it becomes law.  If these bills really are what the people want, then why deliberately block the right of the people to be able to vote to approve them??   That is an abuse of Oregon's Constitution, and undermines the checks and balances in it.  That seems most inconsistent and hypocritical to me.  Take a look at what our Constitution says:  Article IV, Section (3)(a) The people reserve to themselves the referendum power, which is to approve or reject at an election any Act, or part thereof, of the Legislative Assembly that does not become effective earlier than 90 days after the end of the session at which the Act is passed."

0,"This ""problem"" is a recurring complaint that I have heard my entire 60 years. Yes, there are many viewpoints expressed through fashion, and face it, those expressions often fly in the face of parents and other adult sensibilities. But clothing worn in schools is an old and minor problem. When I went through the school system we were not allowed to wear short pants ever. Now they do. It's no longer a big deal, and really, was it ever a big deal except to those who thought short pants showed off the student bodies and interfered with student concentration? Look, clothing does not override good educational practices. This minor blip of a problem isn't new and it's probably not even a real problem to student education. It probably dogged the flapper generation too."

We have no debate about the need for ""Housing First"" programs to assist them in securing safe shelter as a first step toward working their way out of homelessness.    However, that 6% is very much worth talking about.  It fact it's important, first, to point out that it IS 6% and those who cavalierly dismiss all homeless individuals as  ""freeloading parasites"" are very wrongheaded in doing so.    On the other hand, when you include those ""travelers"" (that's the title very commonly used to refer to the voluntarily homeless) in the broad category of ""homeless and deserving our support"", I feel you seriously weaken your case for such assistance.

Those kids have few opportunities in local schools. How about families who want a more traditional education for their kids outside of the wholly progressive education offered by our local far-left educators?

We as a people supported his death because we didn't like how he acted.  We support drones firing missiles to kill sleeping Moslems.  We support jets dropping bombs on innocents described as collateral damage.  We support locking humans in cages for most of their lives for relatively minor property or non-violent ""sex"" crimes.  All of these instances reflect a profound disrespect for the sanctity people's lives.

The local camping ban effectively criminalizes homelessness, requiring the police to harass them and force them to keep moving. If you want to keep the river banks and other places clean, a far better policy would be to provide more legal campsites, with portapotties and trash pickup provided by the city. It would also cost less. The Parks and Open Space Dept. claims that it spends $250,000 per year to clean up homeless camp sites.

0,"That's not the key phrase, except to you perhaps.  I'm supposing the tax is only paid when a business is actually paying wages...employing people...and there are quite a number of businesses who do not have employees all year, or have no employees at some parts of the year, or a seasonal surge of employees. That's why the ""when"" of payment calculations is important...or a more thorough explanation of how this tax is collected.  In terms of bias, yours are usually obvious and predictable, but I am biased against employers who cheat employees, and we're seeing it reported in news fairly often."
0,"That's because you have never met a payroll or had to pay self-employment taxes, perhaps.   I'll assume it was  just ignorance, in any event.    You are correct that this particular tax is based on the employees you pay. If you have one or more employees, you WILL pay the unemployment tax for that or those employees in the quarter which they worked.  The State has a computer system called OTTER to pay those taxes. and other payroll taxes.  The taxes vary from 3-7% of salary per employee depending on the employer's  history employment history.    Just another little government  tax that those who hate business and corporations fail to understand when they think every dime of sales by a business is profit.

The federal officials ""backed down"" to avoid a shoot-out.  Cliven and his supporters whoengaged in this action are now charged with the many federal and state violations they were witnessed committing.

For scholarship athletes, often ""going to class"" is something they have to do in order to play. i.e. ""they go to college so they can play.""  Many of them get a degree and, to varying degrees, an education.  This is good.  However, clearly the entire athletic system is premised on athletics first and education ...a distant second.

0,"Sorry about your friend.  But by far, most violence is committed by locals, people renting or owning homes.   It simply isn't fair to take your frustration out on the thousands of people who have nothing and no one. One criminal assaulted your friend. Take it out on him, at least verbally. I strongly suspect any solution you come up with in your anger will commit a great deal of like violence on your fellow humans. There indeed are individuals who need strong action, including detention for long periods.  If a community refuses to have a public shelter system, and Lane County does not have one, and if that community allows businesses to run off with jobs that pay the rent, then there will be thousands without shelter. If you have a solution that has any chance to help, make that known. All city centers have a devolving problem with poverty.  You take the City of  Eugene to task and I would remind you Springfield has similar or worse problems, as does Portland.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene"

My family no longer goes downtown. We no longer use the library, or the DAC. We rarely attend the Hult or eat downtown. We've been chased out, and I suspect we are not the only ones.

No way to track whether or not a cab is coming, no call from the cab company. Cab companies here in Portland are notorious for this type of thing.    I drive for Lyft when I'm in town, and being a morning person I get a lot of early airport runs. A couple of months ago I picked up an older couple who were using Lyft for the first time because the cab they had pre-scheduled for 4am via Curb called *at 4am* to tell them it wasn't going to show. Pretty sure that's the last time they'll use Curb.

In regards to our modern society, we have no solutions to the first problem because we are locked to archaic notion that jail is the answer.  It is not.  Jail is bad for society because it does nothing to alter behavior and for the ""criminal"" since it is cruel to lock a thinking human in a cage for years and years.  There are other solutions which are now politically incorrect but would be more effective and less cruel to criminals.  It is simple.  In the case of the assault described, the ability of the perp to re-offend should be eliminated.  The perp's arm used in the assault should be surgically removed.   He will never hit again.  He need not be locked in a cage which is cruel and we need not pay millions to keep him there.  Endless jail is more cruel.

No program is ever going to change his nature. In an act of desperation my Chickasaw Uncles booted him from the family, kidnapped my grandmother and their siblings, and brought the family to Oregon to prevent him from inflicting his criminal dysfunction on the family.  Because Oregon lacked affordable housing my family lived in a one room dirt floor shanty. My grandfather hunted down the family, and after he was ran off time and time again, and the community would not address his criminal dysfunction ""spare change"" funded, he locked my family in that shanty and tried to blow it up with stolen dynamite. That's when society stopped making worthless liberal excuses, and sent him to prison where he could no longer inflict his criminal dysfunction on my family and the community again."

If you think this criminal dysfunction is rare you are sadly mistaken and need to take a hard honest look at the Eugene police reports, and what the RG doesn't report on.

When I came to Eugene living on the streets I hustled up a minimum wage job, and paid rent on a shared room at a local halfway house full social parasites leeching off the welfare system. I used to work 10-12 hour shifts 6-7 days a week trying to get ahead. I saw little of my overtime pay that pushed me to a higher tax bracket confiscating my of my overtime pay.

Having lived amongst these people I know all too well their dysfunctional nature, and the nature of their dysfunction.

The students are making most of the decisions themselves, and it shouldn't be a surprise that they often don't make good choices. This shift of power and responsibility is great for the teacher and staff; they claim to be empowering the students but really it's just much easier in many ways.

0,Special ed is far more than expensive babysitting. It is an umbrella category that covers kids needing life skills all the way to brilliant autistic kids who need supports to function in a school setting.

More information readily available would empower more parents to be able to participate in this process.

Why would that be a surprise? Local teacher organizations have also successfully fought even the most hollow and toothless teacher evaluations. Does that mean we shouldn't evaluate teachers?

It has done so, however, with massive revenue shortfalls and debt accumulation. Back to education: the Greeks had what we'd call very informal educational systems, no standardized testing, no teacher evaluations. Bogus comparison. Would you consider the suppression of science as a ""liberal"" thing?  Conservatives are the absolute nemesis of ""classical learning:"" they actively have been attempting to force universities to abandon ""liberal arts"" and concentrate on ""job-worthy"" pursuits.

0,"The answer to homelessness is more affordable housing, the lack of which is both a local and national crisis. We have low wages and high rents.   Until that housing can be built, we need more transitional and emergency shelter, like Opportunity Village and the legal ""rest stop"" camps run by Community Supported Shelters and Nightingale Health Sanctuary. Besides keeping their own camps clean, rest stop residents have volunteered to clean up other sites. Residents of unsanctioned camps, such as OURS, have also cleaned up their camps, with the help of housed volunteers who take trash to the dump.   As for the unorganized camps, the city could help keep them clean by providing portapotties and dumpsters.

By your logic, it would be okay for me to join (insert name of organization you dislike) and give them money on the off chance that the group may change due to my superior reasoning?  There's no solution for Imago Dei.  They are Conservative Baptists and they try and wrap bigotry in religious doctrine so that they can escape criticism.  Because I don't recognize the Bible as holy and because I don't see the Pastor as having spiritual authority, I am writing the whole church off.

Independents have already surged! and their registration exceeds that of Republicans, and at times in last 5 years Dems.     I made my choice for independent registration about 12 years ago now.     I do vote in the general elections but deeply resent that partisan interest keep me from voting in round 1, the primaries,( your point of maximum choice).      How will the political parties work their leverage in Oregon, to keep the independent voter from chosing their represenative?  The majority party candidate in the primary has a very high probability of winning the general election.    Independents are denied that right to participate.  If you want to weaken the grip a bit on the bias created by partisanship, then support efforts to give independents  equal citizenship rights to elect our representative.  What happens when independents outnumber the more powerful minority Parties?"

These sort of cases are why my family and I go out of state for our medical care to the extent possible. We have so few competent physicians in Lane County it's like being in a third-world country.

0.166666667,"Under Oregon rules, it is quite simple to change political affiliation on line. This year I am registered as a Republican because that is the party where I will be able to vote against Commissioner Sid Leiken who is running for Oregon Secy of State and Commissioner Faye Stewart who is running for US Senator. I want to do that because of their fiscal irresponsibility in giving Lane County administrators $800,000 in bonus pay while bemoaning a lack of resources to meet the county’s needs.  The Presidential primary in Oregon has little relevance. Neither major party’s nominee will depend on Oregon voting.  You still have time to do the same if you wish to vote for or against a particular candidate in either of the major parties.  The attempt to have open primaries has already been lost in Oregon and isn't likely to come back up for quite awhile."

0,"The failure to survive or the requirement to seriously downsize by the print media (newspapers and magazines) nationwide and here in Oregon hasn't helped.  The limited ownership here in Eugene of the television stations competing for the same advertising dollar hasn't helped locally, either.  National Radio and Television ""news"" programs earn their money by being more and more partisan.  ""Investigations"" are going be biased at best and non-existent at worst when their own audiences are the ones which should be 'investigated'.   Partisanship has always been involved in the print media.  The Albany  paper doesn't have the word ""Democrat"" in its name from historical accident.  The New Republic has been liberal and progressive  and even pro-Stalin in its early years.  One of the benefits of owning a newspaper is that there is no 'fair comment' requirement like television or radio."

Over time I come to believe that it's not my obligation to lie about party affiliation just to vote.  Step back just a bit Motley.    I am a free citizen of this country.   But 'the rules' contend that I must have declare my allegiance to a Private organization.    To add to the insult, my tax's go to supporting the primary election of these private organization (if they are large enough), but I can't vote in them.  I understand the odds.  The only thing I can control is my own behavior.     It will be interesting to see how many registered voters participate in Oregon's primaries.     I'd bet under 30% of eligible voters will participate."

Are you saying television and radio aren't politically biased, or that they take equal/fair time for both ideologies of all kinds, let alone the two largest Parties.

Name a radio station that doesn't screen it's callers, or a television newscast that provides a counterpoint to every broadcast.  I prefer the print media by far. Most of us don't see bias when we share the opinion.    If you state your opinion, you too are showing bias.    It doesn't mean your wrong, or right, but you have bias, (in the literal sense), to one side or the other.  I'd guess the RG staff opinions align with the majority of Eugene citizens.

0,"Great job, Christina, articulating one of the most frustrating elements a dedicated parent encounters when trying to collaborate with the hard-working, over-burdened and often heroic folks who are tasked with providing education services to our special needs kids - the complete lack of available, current information or consistency in delivery across transitions. Only by becoming a strident, constant advocate for your child and rallying many outside resources to assist you in that cause can a parent uncover what options are available for modifications, what a modified diploma really means, and exactly how the goals of the I.E.P. are being reached. I admire the staff who support my student, but have also voiced my dismay at being completely unable to find my own child's classroom schedule or program name on the school's website anywhere, as if she and her peers don't even exist.

Realistically, there is a reason the R-G has been referred to as ""The Red Guard' for decades; and it definitely reflects the opinions of the majority, particularly the U of O majority.  I think the R-G's willingness to publish other opinons is both a moral decision as well as an economic one.  You get more clicks on this site with opposing views (economic) and if you are the only game in town, it is nice to let  the other side at least cheer for their choices.  I prefer the print media mainly because it is much more difficult to deny a position after publication than in other media.  Re-writing history is much easier for radio than newspapers.

I fault him for stating unequivocally prior to the Jail Levy being passed that passage would not result in a reduction of other general funds going to the jail.  After it passed, he changed his position and said that any position taken by a commissioner prior to a levy couldn't be relied upon or enforced after the levy was passed and that reducing funding to the jail afterward was fine as long as the actual number of beds wasn't reduced.    I was raised to believe that 'your word is your bond'; that even a handshake is binding.   For a politician to say that he can say anything to get a levy passed but whatever he says isn't binding on him or any of the Commissioners means to me that this politician is untrustworthy and needs to be replaced by someone who can be trusted.  He also voted to give the $800,000 increase for the Lane Administrators.  Positive points? Not so much."

0,"Absolutely agree Christina! Our son's transition from elementary to middle school was very difficult because there was almost no information available to us.  We asked questions about programs and were told the information didn't exist, that it didn't matter anyway because an administrator downtown would decide where he would go to middle school.  I found that so shocking at the time, that we as his parents or even his school team had no say on which middle school he would attend.  When I asked why this person wasn't at the table I was told there was no choice but to ""trust the process"" which included NO information about the programs or schools he could attend.  It is really a shame that the more needs a child has, the less information information there is.  It makes no sense why this information can't be available to all parents with children in special education.  Parents need to be fully informed members of their child's IEP team to make informed choices.  This is an equity issue."

Unfortunately, it was at night, so I had no option, other than an emergency room.  Despite the serious nature of my symptoms ( I was have difficulty breathing and talking ), it turned out that I had no medical issue at all. The plug had simply moved, and got into position where it was blocking my breathing. The doctor ordered all kinds of expensive and unneeded tests, and for 5 hours I laid their suffering horribly, struggling to breath.  Finally, she called my ENT, and spoke to an associate on call, who told her that the plug just moved, and simply needed to be pulled out.   She then pulled it out, and I was instantly fine"

At most, it would have been a basic $150 office visit.  Instead, the idiots at PeaceHealth tortured me for 5 awful hours, lying there struggling to breath, and did nothing to help me for all that time.

Some of these are natural distributions and some are from earlier invasions.  In many cases, the genetic strains found in our waters vary slightly from those found on debris.  Currently, our algal project is doing comparative sequencing of these species to determine if the sources of our resident species are from debris or from Asia or elsewhere around the globe.  It has long been recognized that species are transported by currents from Japan to the NE Pacific.  But, the rate of transport has increased dramatically with debris from the tsunami.

If you want to leave this matter in the hands of science, then it is best to allow ODFW to manage the wolf population.

When voters refused to increase property taxes in a deep recession our scamming rat *&^%#@ legislators conspired to raise property taxes through market manipulation at the development stage and bypass the pesky voters.

Urban growth boundaries represent the X while the newly adopted inflationary ""Uniform Codes"" represent the Y. These codes outlawed affordable housing to increase property tax revenue. Until high density planning was adopted we could purchase a home earning the federal minimum wage.

This shameless pathological lie has masterfully deflected from the irrefutable fact HDP has caused poverty, homelessness to explode and what chained the poor to poverty after Oregon had poverty soundly beat through affordable housing.

When Metro Metals took it to the landfill, that chunk set off a detector.   By the time Greenway contacted Bullseye, the chunk in question had already been put into their crusher and was comingled with about 90 tons of other material. It took time to understand what was happening and to get all officials to agree on a plan. Bullseye was then asked to pay a waste company to haul all 90 tons of by-then-comingled material to an appropriate facility.   The lawsuit was in small claims court. It was a dispute between companies over who was responsible for hauling fees -- not environmental wrongdoing.   BTW - materials are common, natural, safe."

There are only 3 very limited exceptions under Oregon Law that allow one to legally discharge a gun inside city limits.   It can only be done if you are (1) trying to stop a person that is committing a felony involving violent force   (2) a burglary is being committed inside a dwelling  and (3) unlawful deadly physical force is being used, or about to be used, against a person  THERE ARE NO OTHER EXCEPTIONS under Oregon law.

I'd suggest part of being mentally-ill is not recognizing or acknowledging that you are mentally-ill.  Therefore, intervention at whatever stage of mental-illness is defined as the threshold for coercive treatment is usually necessary.  This means some sort of commitment for some period of time while it is determined through observation, interviews, etc whether a coercive treatment plan is appropriate.  At which time a request would be presented in court.  It's important that, with early, effective intervention we're not talking about long term commitment to a State Hospital facility.  I recognize this is a very contraversial suggestion.

I would think that the people involved with the Grammy awards know more about music than some douche bag Culture editor for a 2-bit website. Chris Christie likes him so you don't, that's pretty childish. You try to put Garth Brooks on a pedestal because his ticket prices are lower, but you fail to mention Garth has not released a new album in 15 years. Also, I remember seeing Garth Brooks back in his prime, so to speak and his ticket prices were just as high as other bands. When I spend $150 on a Springsteen ticket, I know exactly what I am going to get. A three and half hour rock fest with new music mixed in with old music.

This shameless pathological lie has masterfully deflected from two irrefutable facts, #1 the legislators fully understood they were causing poverty, homelessness to explode, and #2 high density planning is based on the social engineering formula of forcing X amount of homes per acre at Y value to achieve Z highest property taxes per acre as possible. Furthermore, I will reference 2 examples that shows just how shameless this lie is. I bought farmland in Veneta that had been commercially farmed since 1889. I wasn't moved onto my farm 1 week before the Veneta city council expanded their urban growth boundaries, and rezoned my ""farmland"" to force into development.

Attorneys are appointed on current involuntary commitment cases and would continue to be appointed for your 'interventions'.

We used to also be able to deduct what we spent on meds each month for our benefits.  Like it wasn't dollar for dollar but it helped.  What we'd spend on medicine would increase our food stamps.  Now?  Nope.    We can't find growers because they make more $$ selling to the shops.    We have no idea if pesticides were used.  For the same amount of meds for $90. is now costing around $250=300.   There should be a co.op to get patients 'at cost' meds like a number of years ago.

The ""imminent danger to self or others"", in my opinion precludes many mentally-ill individuals from receiving the care they need.  The combination of conservatives who don't want to spend the money, and liberals who don't want to interfere in someone's life, has, across the country, led to tens or hundreds of thousands of quite severely mentally-ill individuals homeless and on the streets without the care they so badly need.    In many, I'd suggest most, cases, mental illness is progressive.  The longer an individual goes without help, the worse it gets.

I am referring to the liberal nature of the  Courts who have defined what is legal or illegal insofar as forcing the mentally ill into treatment or involuntary commitment.  That is in the same sense of the ""liberal"" courts who reverse criminal cases which a more conservative judge would not.    This isn't based on a vote of the people in the State of Oregon,.  Even if the legislature or an initiative says the mentally ill can be forced into treatment, the courts have the final say.  And both the liberal judges and the conservative ones are reluctant to interfere with the personal freedoms of those who aren't dangerous.  My favorite local example is Judge Merten's attempt to commit a woman here in Eugene who habitually bicycles naked day and night.  He believed that constituted a danger to herself.  The Court of Appeals reversed noting that she testified that she never had been raped and was feeding and clothing herself easily."

I'm also interested in food history and the impact that colonialism had on indigenous food cultures, but glorifying colonialism as a restaurant theme is that same romanticization divorced from what colonialism actually was; oppressive, exploitative, bloody, brutal, and destructive. Sure, cultural conquest has been going on since the beginning of time.

In 1968 the minimum wage was raised to  $1.60, vs. $1.00 in early 1967.  In terms of current purchasing power, the value of that $1.60 wage would now be equal to $10.34.   Historically, that is 1968 minimum wage level was the highest ever, in terms of its actual purchasing power.  However, here's the point, and the record is clear: quite soon after the minimum wage is raised, there's an immediate surge in inflation, which works to erode the increase in purchasing power, even totally negate that bump in the dollar wage.  Economists can make a pretty good case that the huge inflation rates we began to see in the early 1970s were triggered by that 1968 bump in the minimum wage.  Inflation is a great enemy of wage earners.  It destroys purchasing power.  Meanwhile, the ""Big Boys"" get to use price increases, and be ahead."

One of the main reasons why Bush Sr suckered Iraq into invading Kuwait was to get Iraqi oil off the market to bail out the bankrupt former USSR and get money flowing there before their nukes ended up on the black market, and bonus dude, it bailed out Mexico that saw runaway inflation turn their peso from 30 to $1 to 3000 to $1.

0.166666667,"Drug use and resulting homelessness have many root causes, so maybe we should withhold quick condemnation of every homeless person.  Yes, some of the alcohol/drug addicted homeless people made bad lifestyle choices and have ended up where they are as a result.  However, not all alcohol/drug addicted homeless people ended up this way because one day they decided this was the life they wanted to live.  Unfortunately for many, childhood issues of neglect and abuse are the root cause that led to this result.  When a child is abused mentally, physically, or sexually, often alcohol/drug use becomes their escape to ease the pain; they're not mentally mature enough to realize the detrimental effects of their actions.  I have  been blessed and have never had to deal with any of these issues, but I am empathetic to the issue of homelessness in our community and help with and donate to various St. Vincent de Paul entities because they excel at addressing homelessness issues in our community."

From the OLCC website the tax revenue is divided as follows: 40 % to Common School Fund,  20 % to Mental Health Alcoholism and Drug Services,  15 % to State Police,  10 % to Cities for enforcement of the measure,  10 % to Counties for enforcement of the measure,  5 % to Oregon Health Authority for alcohol and drug abuse prevention.  The taxes go to law enforcement and questionable drug prevention programs.  It's an issue that must be addressed in the legislature."

Every metropolitan area in the country is struggling with the issue.  A few have developed programs and facilities which are effective.  Most, including Eugene, have not.  So, as Cher would say, ""the beat goes on.""    First, the generic term ""homeless"" is problematic.  People are homeless and destitute for many different reasons: sudden job loss, escaping domenstic abuse, mental-illness, developmental disabilities, alcohol and substance abuse, PTSD and a host of personal problems.  Only a small percentage, by all studies between five and ten percent, are ""homeless by choice.""  Those with ""legitimate"" needs require temporary shelter and long-term assistance to work their way out of homelessness.  The greater community, quite reasonably, wishes to be able to enjoy the city, including parks and open spaces.  We need to do both..not easy"

That is not going to happen anymore, though.  Pure partisanship now rules this state, which is utterly tragic.  When no charges are ever brought in this matter, a lot of people who so strongly condemned Kitzhaber are going to have a lot of egg on their faces."

The U6 rate would be a better comparison, and maybe support your comment or give a boost to motleycrew's, but I can't find current U6 data by state. Oregon's U6 was slightly higher than North Carolina for 2015 averaged out, but since I was pointing out a recent drop in unemployment in Oregon I didn't think that addressed the data I had.   I have friends in North Carolina and they complain the same way about the lack of good jobs. I agree that many good jobs are lacking here... I just think that pointing out that the unemployment rate here doesn't say the whole story doesn't mean that Oregon's numbers are wrong and North Carolina's are right."

You folks are all going to look rather silly, when no charges are ever filed against him.  And no one here said anything positive or good about Goldschmidt on this page.

0,"After having started several companies that successfully attracted substantial venture funding and ultimately sold to large international corporations, I have to comment that creating a start-up company is straightforward provided that one has a sales ready product wanted by a substantial market.  At Universities there is typically great confusion between ideas and products.  An idea that will take years of research to reduce to practice is not a good basis for a company.  In fact, if there is any research at all left, it is likely that a company venture funded to sell potential product will fail.  Some start companies by selling the idea for a product.  If they are smart they can make a bundle from investors before the company fails as investors often cannot tell how far an idea is from being reduced to practice.  It is best start business only when the idea has already been reduced to practice and is ready to sell."

We have to use public transportation, and without it, we are in dire straights. If you think buses are empty, try riding on one up to the UofO when school is in session. 3) Trust. I trust LTD to do its absolute best to get this done with as little damage to the community's commerce as possible. I  think highly of their drivers and the staff I have met. And I am one of the most grumbly cynical residents around. But years of being able to depend on LTD, say to get me to a doctor's appointment in the middle of winter when walking or biking is impossible, means I get to be able to depend on them ten years from now, I should live so long.  I look forward to the construction being over and being able to hop on the bus and get to that part of town.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene"

For example, there was a girl whose “boyfriend” was forcing her to prostitute herself who broke away and stayed with me for awhile and is now doing well, has a job and her own place.  Mostly for me though it’s just about offering a reprieve from misery.  Even if it’s one night in a warm place with a shower and hot food it can go along way toward helping people….or helping them to heal or otherwise.  But like I said, I don’t have the resources for counseling, job placement and things...I do have to work to try and take care of myself as well.

0,"This is a good development for the residents of the area. Even though the new limit must be approved by the State, it represents local control influencing what can be entrenched bureaucracy. The alignment with 35 mph sections will reduce the constant confusion drivers face as they attempt to negotiate ever changing speed limits. Drivers could focus more on other important things like texting, talking on phones, applying makeup, and watching cute youtube videos of kittens.  This will also remove the obvious speed trap designed to unfairly pad the pockets of local elected precinct bosses. With less time devoted to issuing tickets to fund City Hall, police will be able to crack down on the real perps, such as cyclists riding the wrong way, and jaywalking pedestrians. Especially egregious are the slow strolling elderly who wantonly continue across the road despite a light that has changed to say ""don't walk"".

Sure, they are packed with standing room only one way as people go to work or commute home at the end of the day, but seldom have more than few riders on the return trip. I don't know a lot about bus scheduling, but it seems a full bus means the fare is too low, and an empty bus means the fare is too high. This is why I favor ""demand pricing"".  Let's charge more as a bus fills but offer a reduced price for riders going the opposite, less used return route. More capitalism. Less socialism."

0,"Interesting and provocative article.  Personally as a former small business owner and gun owner, I just wouldn't want the onus of requiring employees to  have guns in the workplace.  The minute one purchases a gun, a new set of feelings and questions plague the gun owner.  Am I going to accidentally shoot myself by accidental discharge, shoot another person by being careless, and if I do shoot someone in supposed self defense, who makes the decision if I am in the right.  Like owning a car, a gun owner should have  intensive training for securing a permit...and ideally, liability insurance for his own financial well being.  To make a long story short, having a handgun, which is not permitted in most countries, carries a huge responsibility.  Some numbers paint a vivid picture.  The chance of dying from heart disease in USA is 1 in 467,  assault by firearm is 1 in 24, 974,  and walking across the street is 1 in 54,538, especially in Eugene-Springfield (statistics from the Economist)."

And FWIW your are correct that the response time clock for first responders begins ticking when the call is answered.  911 call handling and dispatch is tracked differently.  I think NAFPA says medical and fire calls are to be dispatched within 60 seconds of picking up the phone 90 percent of the time.  This is a lot quicker than having just a 60 second average.   Then a tougher time standard kicks in,, first responders are supposed to be enroute within 6o seconds of the alarm activating.  Fire misses this standard a bit,, AMR which tends to have crews standing-by in their rigs, is in compliance.  AMR gets fined not being in compliance,,,nothing happens to Fire.

I believe that lack respect for others is a major factor in crime and that lack of respect is taught by societal decisions and actions as in sentencing.  We routinely lock up people for 5-10-20 or more years for non-violent offenses.  The people locked up may have families that are gravely impacted by the loss of a provider.  The people locked up may have invaluable skills or have done great works yet we lock them up without a second thought.  By doing so, we teach that the lives of individual citizens have little value.  We teach that we can dehumanize others and call them pond scum.  If we wish to reduce crime, we must teach the respect and value of our fellows.  Except for premeditated murder, the ultimate crime, we cannot teach dehumanization of offenders without promoting individual emulation.

Look at states where the politics are not like Oregon, states like Kansas, Texas, etc., is Stephen Aloia saying there is tyranny in these states.

But then those same people drive home to use natural gas to heat their houses.  Fossil fuel use will continue as long as alternatives remain vastly more expensive (except in Oregon with the beautiful hydro power available).  I suggest that proponents of natural gas export build their liquefaction plants along existing gas pipelines and use existing rail lines to bring the liquefied natural gas to the port.  Since liquefaction of the natural gas reduces volume by about 1000 times, rail may be able to transport the NG efficiently enough to support export.  Existing rail lines could be upgraded which is good for everybody."

The death rate trends downward steeply as speeds drop below 35 mph. Unfortunately, ODOT doesn't consider anyone not in a motor vehicle when setting their (archaic) standards.  Does anyone else notice that we are adhering to a model that trusts the judgement of motorists to self-regulate their speed to a safe level when we have decades of data that says motorists cannot do so. Our own states rapidly rising roadway death toll, up 14% in 2014 and 20% in 2015, should be an eye-opener. Nationally, we all have about a 50% chance of being injured or killed in a car wreck over our lifetime."

In reality, resources are limited and decisions regarding optimal use of funds must be made.  For every decision to spend money on one thing, we spend less on something else.  In absolute terms, terrorist murder comprises a very small percentage of total murders, yet we spend far more money fighting terrorism than we do fighting other murder.  To do so is irrational, but that is who we are.    More generally, I think that murder is reduced not through conviction and sentencing, but through broad public acceptance and support of the value of human life.  When we as a society treat people as disposable, dehumanize them, call them pond scum, drop bombs on them, or kill them via police, we teach individuals that it is okay to solve personal problems through murder, robbery, etc.  We reap the fruit of what we sow."
0,"I was thinking that too. As a White guy who ""enjoys"" white privilege, I am not in a position to understand Black Lives Matter like a person of color might. But let me try to explain why I think Sanders has been focused on economic justice instead of racial or legal justice. Some assumptions: Blacks have been inordinately impacted by the growing disparity of wealth. White group have proposed that the problem is that Black people lack a work ethic. They do not see the unequal funding of schools, lack of infrastructure, quality housing, and attraction to gangs as a way out of a future of despair.  Added to this are the Right wing establishment like the Heritage Foundation, CATO Institute and Limbaugh that churn out fictions called ""white guilt"" and ""politically correct""  to ignore this economic based discrimination. Sanders would say you cannot begin to address prejudice until the injustice of the economic system is fixed.  So he seems insensitive to the Black Lives Matter."

To compound this problem, LTD's MovingAhead transit group (formerly the failed FrowardThinking transit) now plans to feed more proposed sections (99 & River Rd.) of EmX and ""enhanced"" transit routes using 6th/7th Avenues.  This means bus traffic (60' articulating behemoths) will triple, with a bus passing every 3-4 minutes, on the constricted sections of 6th/7th.  That's 240 bus trips per day on 6th/7th!

Most murders are committed by people who only offend once.  Yes, there are some serial killers, but most murders are from rage or circumstance that does not recur.  Other crimes are like this as well.  Commission of most crimes is by first time offenders.  The notion that killing offenders will reduce crime is largely without factual basis - it just feels good.  Teaching that human life can be forfeit on the false premise that it reduces crime, in my opinion, creates the very atmosphere wherein individuals are prone to take life.  Teach the taking of life and individuals will learn.    Emotionally, i support killing those who resort to premeditated murder.  Rationally, I believe that each time we collectively kill we likely motivate and engender multiple killings between individuals who are simply applying what we collectively teach."

Many people lease entire homes (not legal) and rent them for out of town visitors for 1-29 days, thus depriving citizens of affordable homes in which to live.

The proposed 600 would be in the general area of campus and if they were in place today that would bring the campus apartment vacancy range to approximately 800. And these numbers represent the higher range of rentals since the university is still in session.   The 224 or so campus vacancies will likely double or triple during the summer months. In case the landowner has a way to write off a loss...it seems there is not the demand for another 600 rental apartments to serve the campus area, when the general area currently has 644 vacancies and campus has 224.

Operations floor atmosphere intolerable and selective discipline. They wouldn't have this staffing issue if it werent for management being so horrific to work for. Many long time, highly trained employees are leaving because of management- not the stress of the job.   How is it Novick gave BOEC Director Turley an 'excellent' rating for performance when the bureau is in such a dire situation? My guess would be to cover his rear. Give her a deserved 'poor' rating and it would reflect on him as well.      Oh and as far as calling a fire station with 'buff dudes' to come to a fight- dumb idea."

0,"So when a special needs student goes completely off, disrupting  all the other students, if you can't send them home and you can't isolate them from the other students in 'time out', what, pray tell, is the harried, concerned, and compassionate educator supposed to do?  If you go to OLive and read the full article, and then access the State of Oregon letter, all you discover is that the school's hands are further tied.  They are told what they cannot do and are told to 'prevent' the unruly behavior.  That's it.  ""Policies must “require the school district to take steps to prevent the recurrence of the behavior that led to the out-of-school suspension and return the student to a classroom setting so that the disruption of the student’s academic instruction is minimized.”  The letter links the further requirements to "" Senate Bills 553 and 556, both passed in the 2015 legislative session, further underscore the importance of keeping students in school to the highest degree possible.

0,"In short, a vibrant Eugene is best for everyone.  A lesson learned in urban planning is not to sprawl. Sprawling development takes the vitality out of cities so opportunities for residents are diminished. Sprawling cities are making costly investments to reverse past mistakes. Fortunately, Eugene can direct investments toward further improvements to its existing compact development. With compact development, we can be mobile. We can enjoy stores in our neighborhoods. We can readily interact. We can live more sustainably."
0,"I figured you'd attack the motivations of Mueller based on his former association with LTD. Considering that you hide behind a fake name, how about you tell us your background so we can evaluate whether your arguments make any sense based on your background?  Impugning the motivations of people does not constitute a legitimate rebuttal of their arguments. It is simply character assassination."
0,"Commenting without knowing the facts, as usual. I've lived in the hearts of Atlanta and D.C. Unless you live in slum conditions, you generally have to be wealthy in both cities to have a highly-desirable, high-rise environment for children.   Surveys consistently show that American families with children prefer features that are not present in mid- and high-rise apartments.  But, the main point is that Envision Eugene and SW-SAZ have spent millions of dollars and yet done no fundamental or outcome analysis. The data from Portland is pretty clear: Beyond a certain point, limiting land supply creates higher housing costs and generates pressure for development in nearby areas.   It should be obvious from a day spent looking at a map and driving (yes driving) to Creswell, Junction City, Veneta, etc. that without very savvy planning holding the UGB ad infinatum will displace some of the population who would prefer to live in Eugene to outlying, but nearby communities.   -- Paul"

0.5,"Ironic; the City has successfully engineered commuting chaos into our roads intentionally decreasing vehicle capacity in order to overburden the ever-shrinking lanes of travel and 'force' people into high-density housing, high-density mass transit, high-density work space...and now as the 'engineered to fail' road infrastructure begins to fail, the City wants to have the 'cars' pay for services that have already been paid for through existing fuel taxation. If the idiot's had properly managed the road funds and grown the infrastructure proportionally with the population and vehicle growth, we'd have proper roads... Yea, I'm going to trust the City that can't manage to pave the dirt roads that are prolific around Felony Flats...gee, ya think paved roads would help the property values go up and the crime rates go down?.... and of course a BIG TIP OF THE HAT TO THE FREE-LOADING BICYCLE CROWD WHO DEMAND TO USE THE ROADS THEY PAY NOTHING FOR...pdx bicyclists are one-percenter's."

0,"In general, there are benefits and problems with sprawl and compact growth. Neither is perfect. How one emphasizes the good and bad of each is where the arguments rise. Sprawl offers cheap land (often productive farmland), lowering building costs while providing more open development with single family housing that many people enjoy and even see as a sign of ""making it"". Neighborhoods also have more control over the social climate with more homogeneity. But it also requires large amounts of land, longer commute times (pollution and cost), longer bus routes, longer distances to provide city services and often a sense of isolation (some people like that). Compact growth saves arable land, encourages alternative transit, reduces pollution, increases a neighborhood feel, is less costly for city services, adds diversity and supports local retail. But it creates congestion, makes parking more difficult, forces encounters with ""strange"" people,  & housing is often costly. Which is better?"
0,"OK. put down the Kool-Aid and check your history.  First, how do you define ""sprawl""?  Second, during what period did America's large city's experience the greatest ""sprawl""?  Oh, and side note ... where do you live? Some of us have been living in old, single-family neighborhoods and walking to stores and work for decades. Envision Eugene is an excellent plan to degrade these neighborhoods and regenerate the exodus of families to further out.  -- Paul"
0,"You omit the qualifier: ""These high-density suburbs compensate for the comparatively low density of LA’s urban core, and, in so doing, increase the average density of the area as a whole. In other words, Los Angeles has both a relatively high density and a relatively even distribution of density throughout its urbanized area."" You say ""po-ta-toes"" I say ""po-tah-toes""."
0,"I don't have the statewide data on all Oregon charters but there are certainly different drivers in Oregon than in others states.  One is the closing of rural schools by ever larger districts. The other is serving a high need population through innovative programs.  If these are common reasons to form charters than we are serving these students pretty well.  Data is a funny thing and too many people in the ""charter"" discussion have agendas and the data is therefore a bit sketchy. Your last point is that charters statewide are falling short but the whole point of charters is to serve students in their watershed, not statewide.  If you want statewide markers ban charters and build a system that is conforming to the state's goals. If you want Elkton to have a school and a local identity, while serving their students after their district decided bus time was better, to have a local option, there are other ways to fund schools to help keep small communities alive."

Thanks to our friend Eve childbirth hurts, or so the story goes.

Marine animals - seals, otters etc haul out to give birth."
0,"Any time a pro-density opinion piece appears I have to ask myself where in the city this author lives and whether he/she truly has skin in the game or is just issuing prescriptions for the rest of us from the vantage point of  altitude. Wanty had it right and a little circumspection, sans ideology, will tell you that is so. Eugene has a personality disorder and one major manifestation is this propensity to decide for others how best the rest of us should live.  Not everyone wants to be jammed into smaller and smaller spaces and have our method of transit determined by amateur social engineers who live in some kind of delusional dream world about human behavior.  Just because ""they"" come doesn't mean we have to move over to make room. Envision Eugene is fatally flawed and a prime example of the dictum: The path to Hell is paved with good intentions."""

0,"[... continued] Mueller is at his best with ""Thank goodness more rational, professional voices prevailed"" and widened W 6th and 7th Aves to four lanes each. These two streets were already serious barriers, separating the Westside from our sister neighborhood Whiteaker and walking to the river. They became essentially a Trump-like ""wall"" after they were widened even further. I moved into the Westside decades ago because of its ""walkability,"" and I'm still agile enough to dodge the cars and get from south of W. 6th & 7th Aves. to the river and back. But Mueller appears not to understand that increasing through traffic capacity contributes to increased use. So , BIG THANKS to the professional voices who widened 6th/7th.  Mueller oozes condescension with his ""NIMBY"" slur and ""a lot of folks often only get actively involved in civic matters when their own little slice of paradise is threatened."" Yet Mueller is quick to defend ""MY little slice of paradise."" Classic true believer's hypocrisy."
